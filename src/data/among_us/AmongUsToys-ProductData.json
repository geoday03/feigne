          "This Among Us Airship toy is a great size for collectors of the figurines, fans of the game and older children who may play the game but still engage in imaginative play. The ship itself is very durable and interactive; it arrives with a foam inside that holds all three figurines that arrive with the set. This foam can be removed of maintained as a display piece, as the other side of the ship has the Among Us logo on it. The features of the airship have been carefully detailed, with the front of the ship is painted in a displayable fashion. The propellers also can be moved and add to interactive play.\n\nThe figurines are the same, high-quality plastic, made for both play and display, and have details added that imitate the looks in game. Even the eyepieces on the figurines have been painted to carefully resemble the Among Us characters in game. They are the same height and shape as other collectors‚Äô figurines, so they can be compatible with the surprise figures from a previous collection.\n\nThis ship and crewmates airship set would make a fantastic gift for any fan of the game. It is a quality set that is both interactive and displays well. It compliments an established Among Us figure collection but also serves as a starting point for those who want to start collecting. I would definitely recommend it.",
          "P",
          "The Among us game has become a massive Internet success. My kids love it, and I'm happy to see there are now toys and other products based off the hit game. This toy is a representation of a hover-capable aircraft (like a harrier). This is accomplished/simulated by the engines on the airship rotating from horizontal to parallel.\nInside the airship there is a foam insert containing small cut-outs for the three included characters.\nFun toy for my sons (age 7 and 9). 5-stars!",
          "I got this Among US toy for my son for his birthday and he loves it. He is a huge fan of the game and I knew this toy would be perfect for him. It comes with the aircraft, which can be played with and used as a carrier, and three figurines. It's well made and nice quality. This would be a great toy for any kid who loves Among Us or it could be a collector item. Either way it's awesome and I would recommend it. My son has played with it a lot and has so much fun with it.",
          "My 7-year-old son is obsessed with Among Us and absolutely loves this toy. There is no assembly required. There is black foam inside the ship which can hold the 3 Among Us figures and you can also remove the black foam. My son leaves the black foam in so the figures don't roll around the ship. It would have been nice if the hats could be removed and interchanged between figures.",
          "The ship isn't hinged so you can't just open and close it. It comes apart from the bottom. This irritates the 4 yr old for some reason lol. He wants to be able to just open and close it, like a hinged lid. He thought he broke it. But ita just that while there is a latch on one side to help keep it closed, there is no hinged to keep it attached to the other half. There are 2 little magnets to help hold it together, but they really don't do much. The little snap latch is what mainly holds it together, but the magnet side can still come open. And if you try to open the magnet side while leaving the latch side latched, the latch just comes open anyway. So the product picture up there where it looks like it is setting open with the top part up, is very misleading because you can't do that.\n\nSo basically it is more of a case to hold the 3 figures, but is also playable. He still likes it, regardless. He loves Among Us. Been playing it since he was very young, surprisingly. This little guy is a whiz at games somehow. It is mindblowing for his age. He is crazy good at all the Mario games. But that's irrelevant and I'm babbling now.\n\nThis set is good as a collector item or an actual toy for play.\n\nThe characters are solid.\n\nSet seems to be well made, yet slightly overpriced for what it is, but that is typical with this type of stuff.\n\nThe ship is not the hard clanky plastic. A little softer, more durable.\n\nAll in all, not bad. Kid loves it. I just wish they opted for a more secure way to open and close the ship and not have to just take it apart into 2 pieces.\n\nOne figure is outside of the ship attached to the box and the remaining 2 are inside the ship, nestled in a foam insert. Hope to see more items we can add to his ever growing collection.",
          "My son loves playing the Among Us game. This is a great toy for fans of the game! Very nice and high quality! Highly recommended!!",
          "My 10-year-old was pretty excited about this, but he only spent maybe 10 minutes playing with it, then he just put them on his display shelf.\n\nThe ship is basically just a case to hold the little guys. They're made well enough, given that the game itself has cheesy low-budget graphics.\n\nMy kid likes it well enough, but I would say this definitely isn't worth $40. Maybe $15."

There's also brightness levels on the remote, and stuff like rainbow and strobe settings that are pretty neat.

          "I normally am not a review writer, but felt like these deserved one. I was honestly expecting cheap breakable plastic, but these are surprisingly thick and durable. They‚Äôve already taken quite the beating from our kids and are holding up very well. I was also hesitant on ordering since they ship from China (I didn‚Äôt want to have to wait forever for them to arrive) but they took 13 days from the day I ordered to get here and that is insanely fast for shipping all the way from China. I‚Äôve had clothing store orders take longer to arrive. We also received a surprise Among Us drawstring storage bag that I don‚Äôt remember seeing in the listing. It‚Äôs very cute and perfect to keep the characters from getting lost when they‚Äôre not in use. Our package didn‚Äôt include the brown character, but we got two of the teal characters (so still 12 total). But our kids don‚Äôt mind so it wasn‚Äôt a huge deal. Overall very impressed and highly recommended.",
          "I ordered the 24 pc set. They are so cute!! About 3‚Äù-4‚Äù inches in height, hard plastic and their bodies can be taken apart and also the ‚Äúhats‚Äù can be taken off and put on a different character. My 7 yr old loves them!",
          "I was so excited to see that my package was delivered as promised! They made the cake look fabulous. My husband and I love them because they allow my son to use his imagination and cut screen time.",
          "These were much bigger than I thought they were going to be. I was expecting hatchimal size, these are bigger and better!!! They each came individually wrapped. You can taken them apart and change out the top hats. It also came with a cute among us drawstring bag and 50 adorable among us stickers! Keep in mind these are made of some sort of hard plastic, but they‚Äôre super thick so their very sturdy! My 7 year and 9 year old loves these!!",
          "I‚Äôll admit I didn‚Äôt read any reviews, I didn‚Äôt read about their size, and I don‚Äôt think I even looked at the rating - I just bought them. My two boys play pretend Among Us all the time so I thought ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get some figurines.‚Äô To my happy surprise it came with a bag to keep the toys in, their innards, hats, and bodies are interchangeable (which is a total plus), and it came with stickers. What kid doesn‚Äôt love stickers?! Another bonus, they aren‚Äôt itty bitty and they‚Äôre made of durable thick plastic/rubber substance, which means they won‚Äôt crack down the sides like an Easter egg or bend in half like a McDonald‚Äôs toy. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",
          "A little long, but bear with me. So, since my child has been in elementary school I've given gift bags to the class and/or for the birthday party (usually very small and just close friends, so in no way birthdayzilla). So, this year I chose Among us, since during lockdown that became a favorite. But as with any parent who they thinks they know what their kid likes, only to find out that was so last week, I was worried because now Friday Night Funkin has been the flavor of the month, with next to no gift opportunities for parties, birthdays, or basically anything (and believe me I tried!). However, with a pandemic still bumbling along, I arranged with my youngster to have a party somewhere outdoors when it gets warmer...or so I thought. Young one informed me that they told all their friends about the party on Saturday (this was Wednesday) so I started scrambling. Well, it turned out the mouse house their heart was set on would enforce a full vaccination mandate for 5-11 on the day the party would happen. Try as I might, no vaccines before then, so I had to inform my beloved that the party would have to wait. Much disappointment! And I get it. My child really doesn't ask for much and weathered isolation as an only like a, very lonely, trooper. So, I really wanted to do something special at home to make up for it. So, the family decided on a video game treasure hunt for presents, with an Among us theme (since no FNF). So I searched frantically for decorations, and since we don't like balloons and stuff, choices were limited. I opted for a table cloth, a huge sign, and these figures of Among us characters around the table in all forms of Among us chaos (if you've played the game you know what I mean). Well, I was worried about timing, but they came when they said they would. They are about 2.5 inches tall, well made and open up to a little bone for when they are eliminated. I had fun decorating with that, lol. One was reading a book (a present), a few were in conversations, a couple eliminated...It looked great! I ended up not needing 24, but no worries because they became party favors for when the birthday party actually happened. They are good quality, larger than expected and didn't smell bad (you know what I mean). So these are great! Like really saved a hohum idea and made it more special.\nNow, just a few notes. They all come separately wrapped in plastic little baggies, which might be a deal breaker for you. Also, the 24 pieces were 2 x the 12, which was not an issue for us but may be for you. Finally, if you want the figurines, make sure that's what you order and not the candles. Ours came with a small backpack that I store them in. All on all, my tween played with them and thought they were really cool, so if your child is younger it would be an even bigger hit. I definitely recommend them if you have an Among us fan in the house (and even the adults were impressed, so I actually mean it). I don't write reviews often, but these figurines were worth my time. Hope this helps!",
          "I bought these for my Among Us obsessed child. He absolutely loves them! They seem well-made and they are a good size, not teeny-tiny & fit nicely in your hand. The pieces are all sturdy and it doesn't seem like anything will break. The hats and 'guts' are all interchangeable. Overall I am pleased with the quality and value. My kid has been playing with these toys instead of the video game all afternoon so I am very happy with my purchase!",
          "I just opened these- I set them aside for Christmas and hid them. These are AMAZING and my son is going to LOVE THEM. These are pretty big, and they cut if half just like in the game with the bone sticking out. Lots of colors and weird accessories. They came with a bag instead of in a box, so some creativity will be required from the North Pole, but everything was packed nicely, and the bag was a bonus. There was also stickers included. Absolutely wonderful : )\n\nUpdate- my son LOVED this for Christmas and played with it for hours. He even shared with his toddler sister. I got a little box for them and he went nuts when he opened it because he had never seen them in a store : )",
          "Es genial. Lo ped√≠ el 16 nov y lleg√≥ el 30 al Edo. de M√©xico. Est√°n las 24 piezas y la bolsa con los stickers. Solo abr√≠ uno para verlo porque son para reyes para mis dos nenas, esta muy bonito y de buen tama√±o para que no se pierdan.\nMi √∫nica observaci√≥n es del rastreo del paquete, solo se actualizo hasta el despacho de aduanas y no cambio hasta que me llamaron y entregaron.",
          "",
          "I was shocked at their size they‚Äôre great, my kids will love them, might fight over the bag though which is super cute, stickers are a great bonus as well. 10/10 would recommend. I was skeptical at first, I thought it came from US, found out after purchasing that it came from China, but it came a week before my delivery date. Thank you üòÉ",
          "W",
          "I bought these Among Us figures for my 8 yr old and she loves them. They are pretty large and can take a lot of beating form being played with. It comes with a Among Us bag and a handful of vinyl stickers, which btw I'm keeping for myself. Anway, I would definite get more ...",
          "Compre el paquete de 12 piezas, todos est√°n en buenas condiciones y el material se ve de calidad. Venia con una bolsa y stickers tal como dice la publicaci√≥n.",

          "This 12 Inch Among Game US Plush was chosen for my 10-year-old son, who enjoys the Among Us game. As seen in the photo, it has found a home among his other plushies. This plushie arrived in a vacuum-sealed bag and immediately came to life when unwrapped. This plushie is approximately 12 inches long from head to toe and 6.5 inches deep from the most protruding points in the front and back.\n\nThis plushie does have a tad asymmetrical shape. For example, the right leg is more rounded than the left, what I assume is the eye is slanted at tad to the left, and the top of the head is lopsided. My son, on the other hand, doesn't seem to notice (or care), enjoys playing with this plushie, and gives it 5 stars. The stitching is lovely, and the fabric is extremely soft. When I opened it, there were no odors. My son likes how colorful and soft this plushie is. He also likes how big it is because it makes it easier to play with.",
          "¬†I know this isn‚Äôt a dog toy but my 4 year old Boston Terrier loves to suck on stuffed animals, she‚Äôs done this since she was a baby. I knew she would love this, whatever it‚Äôs supposed to be, it has a minimal shape with a hump, perfect for sucking on. She went nuts for it and immediately claimed it as hers and sucked on it for 15 minutes. She wore a hole in it right away, the material is paper thin. It‚Äôs cute but really thin material, doubt it would stand up to much hard play."

          "Nice toy! My son loves them. I strongly advise not to let these toys sit outside under UV light as sun exposure could degrade paint and cause pvc leaching. Hot water in a bathtub over time could also result in leaching. There is always a risk playing with pvc toys. PVC is a toxic material. PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is a widely used plastic often containing harmful chemicals, including such known carcinogens as vinyl chloride, dioxin and phthalates, which are linked to asthma, allergies, and reproductive problems. Be careful not to allow young children chew on them. My son understands the risks and he just makes it where the characters exposure to sunlight or heat cannot be a part of the lifestyle for Among Us characters. Remember the gremlins? They could not be exposed to three things and they were sunlight, water or be fed after midnight or they would die. Wash with cold water and antibacterial detergent. Avoid alcohol and other paint stripping solutions for cleaning. Other than that, have fun and don't forget to do your tasks or YOU may be SUS!",
          "I‚Äôm actually surprised at the quality and details of these toys, they are the pricier among us toys but it was worth it. The sculpts are nice and the material is strong and thick, all the little hats and accessories are well detailed. I really can‚Äôt complain, the kids love them. It comes with an assortment of 12 little among us dudes so don‚Äôt let my picture confuse you, I just couldn‚Äôt fit all of them in my pics. The figures behind the among us are all roughly 7 inches tall to give you an idea of their size",
          "These figures are a great value! They‚Äôre fairly large. Some pieces like the hats and the insides are a painted plastic, and it looks like the paint will wear off eventually. I bought them for on a road trip for two boys ages 9 and 5 and they were thrilled! Lots of different creative games to play. Hats are removable and the bone inside comes out too. They will be well loved for a long time!",
          "My kids love the game and now they can have creative play with figures. They like the interchangeable pieces and the fact that they all open to reveal the signature AU bone inside. Really cute!",
          "If your kids play Among Us this is a great little set. They come a part and have the little bone inside just like when the Imposter kills someone in the game. I got these fir my grandkids 6&7 and they absolutely loved them. They are well made and super cute.",

          "The figures are bigger then I thought they would be and made of a hard plastic. I am very happy with the quality of the figures and how you can take off/trade the hats. After you pull them apart they fit back together nice and snug which will be great for long time use with the kids!"

I bought this item for my nephew's birthday and it even came withe a free party themed drawstring bag and around 20 Among Us 2\" stickers! What a nice surprise. ü•≥",

          "They are sturdy and well made! My son loved them and they are great for his birthday cake!",
          "The coolest toys ever. If your kid loves among us these are a MUST BUY!!!",
          "From the photos I expected all of these little guys to come apart at the waste, and that they would have the bone sticking up inside of them. Nope. Only one was able to be taken apart and only one has that little bone. I know this cause I took 2 others apart. I thought maybe they were just mashed together really well because it took a knife and a lot of force to get them apart. Definitely durable. What k didn't understand was why they all had a cut all the way around their middle, suggesting that they do come apart, if they really didn't? It just made me think I wasn't trying hard enough and I ended up tearing 2 of them up because of it. The hats do come off but they aren't interchangeable without some effort. The notches they fit in to on their heads are cut into odd shapes, so when switching between figures, you have to smash some of them down to make them stay and others are too big and just fall off. Also, their feet are not flat, so they don't stand up. They are so cut very oddly and some have rounded bottoms. They just fall right over. Regardless, my son was still happy to receive them. In the package they also sent us a little among us f\nDraw string bag and like 30 among us stickers which were extremely cute. I stole a few for myself. Lol.\n\nOverall I'm disappointed with the purchase and would have sent them back had I not tore two of them apart.

The are small and cute and a great size that can easily be held in your hand. They look just like the ones from the game.

          "¬†When these arrived, my kids fought over who would get these. Somehow, these little plush crew toys captured the imagination of my 10, 11, and 14-year-old. Luckily, there's plenty in the bag and the fight was limited over who would get which color. They are small-sized plushies (they fit in the palm of my hand) and are great for pretend play. Everybody has their own crew. The squeeking drives me crazy, but at least I know they are being played with. Check out the video I uploaded to hear the noise these plushies make. These plushies are quite soft. It seems they used a good quality of materials and did a good job on the stitching. I just had to cut of the little white tags and they were good to go. These would work well as party favors for birthdays.",

          "The little squeeze sound inside each plushie is pretty lame ‚Äî sounds like the sound from a rubber duck or a dog chew toy. But the plushies are a good size, about the size of my fist, the sewing and fabric look well done and god quality. The colors are vibrant, and although a couple of the greens are close in shade, they are all different colors from one another. I would definitely purchase this item again.\n\nIf you have questions or found this review helpful, please let me know!"

We had to be creative and used some real lego pieces for replacement even though it is not perfect but it works. Also the pieces don't stay tight together and randomly dropped out easily."

          "The 3D Game Night Among Us Lamp that I got for my son who is heavily into gaming has been a great little addition to our home. He loves the design of the product as well as the fact that it comes with a remote that allows it to have a ton of cool preset colors and options. Right now, it is in his bedroom, but it is small enough to be taken anywhere, and is easy to assemble and disassemble. Not quite sure what makes the product ‚Äú3D‚Äù except that it sort of has the effect like the LED-bordered signs you see at restaurants for neon special boards. It is a cool little light, compact with a lot of features, and it can be changed to colors for a party or for using as an energy efficient night light assuming you can plug it in to a USB thing somewhere. BUT it also takes batteries, which makes it a relatively dynamic little nightlight that can be taken camping in a tent and last quite a while on a few batteries. Is it worth the price point of $18 that it is currently at? Not sure about that, except the licensing / illustration appears to be genuine while the box is somewhat unbranded. If anything, that is what you are paying for, but if you are just in the market for a light you can get the same thing a lot cheaper, I am sure ‚Äì the craftsmanship feels a little cheap even though it looks great in the room. It is up to you if the price is right."

          "I bought this item to help me in my small business. Now, I realize that it's not just helping me in business concerns, it's become a third hand of sorts for my whole life. I can track everything - perhaps not a revolutionary idea these days. But for me, this is the first touch-screen \"smart\" device I've ever owned. I've had to learn a lot, but this device made that process much easier. Some devices (or their designers) seem to think that you should have a degree in rocket science to understand and use their tech; Samsung wants people to be able to integrate the device into what they do so that they don't have to THINK about it, just use it, as effortlessly as they do a regular notepad and pen or any other tool.\n\nAnd that is what this is for me now. An invaluable tool.\n\nThough I did break down and put one or two games on it. :P",
          "Love this tablet! I have had it for about a month now and am very happy with it. I have had samsung galaxy phones for the past few years and am always happy with them, this is no different. I like that i can have access to any android app I want and they run nicely on it. The screen size is perfect for reading, exploring apps, etc. The speakers are much louder than I anticipated. I plugged a bluetooth speaker into it to play music outside, but the tablet's speakers were twice as loud as my speaker was! If you want a tablet with a decent camera, this is not it. I use it every once in a while for snapchat, but it isn't even good enough for that. Overall, the quality is great and can't beat the value for the price!",
          "This is my 3rd Samsung Tab 4 10.1 I love it. But it is not long lasting as the tablet sides start separating and light shines thru\nthe sides. 3 1/2 yrs first time 2yrs. next. Now this new tablet is a newer and slightly different. This one has just WIFI no 4G Lte.\nThe settings are a little different but just the way they are setup. So basically this is the same great tablet I love. Maybe this one\nwill stay longer.",
          "Great little tablet and as good as new, only much cheaper! It was originally an AT&T version and asked for a sim card when booting up but it was easy to ignore the notice and keep going if you don't want to add a sim card to make calls. AT&T customers can add a sim card for almost nothing, make calls from it and use data when away from wifi.",
          "Bought this to replace a tablet that had died. First we bought a new tablet of a different model because a new replacement was not available. After 5 days,and tech help,we gave up and returned it. Then we purchased this used tablet and are very pleased. It did not come with instructions, but we were able to set it up in a few hours. Would have been nice if it had come with a charger.",
          "Clear display, responds quickly. Bought as gift for my daughter, so I didn't want to put as much money into a tablet as I would for myself. Works just as well as my Samsung tablet that I purchased new for over $600. Very pleased and will be purchasing another for myself since my son shattered the screen on mine ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
          "Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 is the perfect sized tablet for lounging in bed & reading a book, playing games, watching movies, just checking email etc. I love the option of adding a micro SD card to increase storage space when needed. The android OS is perfect & has all my favorite apps! I would highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 for anyone looking for a perfectly sized tablet that's reasonably priced with all of the great features one would want from a tablet.",
          "I bought 3 of these refurbished units. The only problem i had was one of them had charging issues. Rather than sending it back, i spent the 7 or so dollars for a new internal charging ribbon cable. Easy to install and it fixed the problem"
