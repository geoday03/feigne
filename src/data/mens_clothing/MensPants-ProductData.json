					"I'm very disappointed in these. I bought these in 3 other colors (black, light khaki and dark khaki) several months and they are great pants. So I figured I'd get them in a couple new colors (navy, grey) and it was very obvious these were not the same pants. They feel cheaper and of lower quality. The worst part though is after just ONE wear, I noticed the pants getting rub marks/wearing material. I get it. I have very muscular legs. They're big. They run. That's fine. But the other three that are at least 5 months old show no wear (see khaki picture to compare) but these show tremendous wear after 2 wears in this picture. I'm very disappointed. Especially after the great experience with the other three pairs I have.",

As such I don't have much experience with these types of pants but I'll give my two cents, first impressions and a future follow up.\n\nFirst off, I don't know what D3 Dockers are but do agree with other reviewers that the material is pretty thin. It is also stretchy to a small degree which I like because I'm makes the pants very comfortable to wear. The for is spot on perfect and it's the for in the legs that set these apart for me. I have another pair of wranglers khakis that fit very good as well and are thicker, but I'd have to give comfort to these Dockers.\n\nNow I haven't had these very long at all, just tried them on with shoes and did a wide range of movements with them. I do feel that over time, and sooner than other pants these will wear out in hotspot areas. This remains to be seen however. I ordered 5 pairs that I will be rotating through I'm sure I'll get a variety of experience with how these truly perform.\n\nAs far as colors go I'd say their accurate, though I ordered one pair, something Pebble color perhaps, and no one who sees them can agree on whether they are dark gray or brown or dark green. They'll still work very well with the typical business casual shirt colors of today though.\n\nAll in all I'm happy with them and I will update this review as I wear them in.",
					"I'm very picky about pants and the only other pants I own that I really like are Khaki Dockers Classic Fit. I've been looking for gray dress pants for a while and after buying and returning another brand of pants I decided to buy these Burma Grey Dockers. I should've bought these from the start.\nI bought 1 size up, normally I wear 36W x 29L but I purchased 38W x 30L just in case it was too tight. It fit fine and I can actually pull it up higher which I honestly prefer. The material of the pants is decent. It feels pretty sturdy, it's not going to rip anytime soon. I've worn it 4 times in the span of 1 1/2 months and there is no wear or tear anywhere. The front button is still holding up too. There's no loose threads anywhere either.\nOverall, this is a great pair of pants, nice color, material, fit and look.",

					"Dockers needs to sit in the naughty chair. Not what I expected at this price point. After one month of wearing once or twice per week to a business casual job, the color and fabric are fading and wearing outlines of my wallet and my cellphone through the pockets. There are mystery rips frilling out and unthreading in them too. I would think I'd notice if I was running into anything that was cutting through my pants, but nope. They seemed nice at first, but not for long. The stitching is also coming loose around the belt loops. Again, it's only been a month, so maybe 4 or 5 washes. See my pictures. They look like they're about 10 years old even though they're basically brand new.",
					"My husband has gone up a waist size. I got him some new pants and they are snug, so I went to the 36 waist size (he was a 34). They fit him nicely except for the thighs that are too big. All his pants are too big in the thigh. I am not worried about that. I will try for not such a loose fit on him. I like the dockers because the material is nice and he can wear them to church.",

					"I wrote a positive feedback for this item earlier when I tried the first pants. I ordered two pants and did not use the second pants until today.

I like these pants because they are comfortable and have a 'Casual' look.\nI ordered the same pants in the Heather Storm (grey) however this color makes them look much more like 'Dress Pants' which I do not want, so I returned them.",
					"Not the Docker fabric I am used to - very shiny like oldschool dress pants, not business casual/workwear. Hoping with a few aggressive washes the nap in the fabric gets raised and this improves.\nLeg fit is also not the same as usual dockers - feels like I have bell bottoms on which also kills the business casual vibe."

					"This review is for the Haggar Men's Premium No Iron Expandable Waist Plain Front Pant in the Classic Fit. I was looking for a business casual pant that was a small step up from my 100% cotton Izod Men's American Chinos that I've been wearing for years and these Haggar pants fit the bill.\n\nI normally take a 40W 30L pant and these Haggar pants fit me true to size in those measurements. Since the fabric is a mix of 61% Cotton, 37% Polyester, 2% Spandex the cloth has a little stretch to it which is very comfortable without being too stretchy. The fabric also has a bit of a sheen compared to 100% cotton chino or khaki pants and I think this gives these pants a slightly more dressy look without being a full dress pant. The material is medium weight and fully lined and seems sturdy and well-made. The classic fit works well for me as I have larger thighs and appreciate a little extra room there.\n\nThe pants wash well and, if taken from the dryer when finished, come out smooth and sleek and need no-ironing as the name suggests.\n\nSo far, I'm very satisfied with these pants and the next step will be to see how well they hold up over time.",
					"Bought these for my husband who loves the expandable waist band. Easy to care for, machine washable and hang to dry. They don't need ironing. Will buy this brand again and again. Fit was just as they said on the size chart.",
					"W",
					"Nice pants, great fabric and just as described. They fit like they were hand tailored. Easy to recommend.\nFoe some scale - I'm 6'4\", weigh 225lbs and am what people would say 'well proportioned.",
					"I got these pants for working at the Oakland A's games and they were an instant hit. Not only are these great looking...they offer comfort, durability and value. We all all looking for the most bang for our buck..and these slacks didn't disappoint. All this value at such an affordable price- whats not to like?\nSoon after using 1 pair a few days ,I quick ordered another. Now ,the only thing I need to do is try the other colors as well.",
					"I",
					"I wasn't sure if the 32' length was long enough for me (I'm 6\"2) but I found it just right, resting just at my shoe top. More \"break\" than the modern kids seem to like, but at 43 I guess I like more \"break\" for my buck. These are also very comfortable. I use them as my work pants. As a banker I am up and down from my desk and walking around the office. In fact, I bought a second pair because I love them so much! Easy to clean and dry. No ironing needed. My busy family life can't afford more time for to much clothing care.",
					"30” length turned out to be about 32”.\nHence return but speedy refund.",
					"Really good quality as always with Haggar trousers. Purchased as a more formal going out trouser and they fit the bill superbly.",
					"G",
					"I already have an identical pair in a different colour, purchased the time-honoured way: I drove to an over-crowded mall, paid WAY too much for a CinnaBon and a mediocre coffee, pawed over the racks for the brand I knew I wanted, and then tried them on in a flimsy changing room that has better security provisions than my bank.\nNo matter what the leg length they say, the first trip after purchase is still to my tailor.\nSo, after a decent purchase price, avoiding the mall (and Cinnabons), and after dropping a few extra bucks on my tailor's counter, I am pleased with this purchase.",
					"Pants are light weight , so more ideal for spring/summer . Zipper appears to be brass , so should be alright . Pockets are fairly large . I'm satisfied with the elastic as well , because it has plenty of gentle give to all four elastics (two on each side , which overlap one another with one of them hidden in the waist band ) .Purchased another style of Haggar with stretch waist band and the wide elastic which rested against you was so firm , there was almost no give at all which defeated the softer elastic hidden in the waist band . These were good .\nUpdate ...bought a second pair ."

					"These slacks literally came ready to wear.\n\nI didn't have to do anything to them but slip them on. They are comfortable and being wrinkle resistant they hold up over a busy day. I am up and down through the day when I am traveling for work, and these pants still look good at the end of the day. Love the way they feel and definitely like the way they look. There are several colors to choose from, and I have already order different ones to wear with various outfits.\n\nPerfect for life on the go. These slacks are what I need to stay looking and feeling good.",
					"These are great, if not perfect, dress slacks. I purchased the blue pair and they fit comfortable, give just enough room to be comfy and not too tight, but damn do they ever collect hairs and random bits and pieces of fluff. I have worn them a handful of times and had to run a lint collector over them twice a day to ensure I do not look like a homeless guy who walked through a petting zoo. I would not call these Wrinkle-Free but certainly Wrinkle-Resistant, by the afternoon of sitting at a desk you will have wrinkles.\n\nI have now added the grey and khaki pants to my closet as well.",

					"I love the look and the feel of these pants. They allow you to switch it up when it comes to your wardrobe, wearing them for casual to business casual.\n\nThe fit in the waist and the length is just what I expected. They are comfortable and affordable, which means that you can get several colors to go with your wardrobe and not worry about breaking the bank.",
					"Label says it is 60/40 cotton/poly. In no way is there any polyester in this pants. Within 5-10 minutes of wearing the merchandise, everything starts to balloon and lose it's shape.

					"Soft, durable pants that have faded beyond all reason. We ordered black and now they're gray. I only wash in child with Tide. My son wore them to work as a server and after a month he was told he couldn't wear them anymore. If color doesn't matter, the material had held up. Good for working where appearance doesn't matter.",
					"I",
					"I have to start with the price...wildly cheap.\nI usually pay £40-50 for my chinos from a well known online apparel company and while these trouser are not quite as good quality they are good quality especially for £19.\nThings I like,\nThe waist fit. They fit on the waist, not above and not below it.\nThe material. The material, while not top quality is good quality.\nThe overall fit. The fit is almost exactly the same as my expensive chinos.\nApart from the slightly less robust quality of the material, the only real differences are that the company from which I normally order chinos tailor them to my exact leg length and offer waist sizes from 32inches, rising in 1 inch increments up to 44inches. Then, for up to £30 more per pair you'd expect a little something extra.\nThings I don't like.\nBelt loops. There are fewer belt loops on these chinos but only one fewer so I suppose I am picking nits, although, I do think it makes a difference.\nTrouser cuffs. I don't like the jeans type of cuff finish. My usual chinos have traditional plain trouser cuff hems and I prefer them. Call me picky.\nIf closely looked at, in the places people don't see, these trousers are not as well finished as my other chinos and the material doesn't seem quite as heavy duty.\nI bought these trousers to wear about the house and in the neighbourhood to save my other more expensive olive green chinos but really, I have worn and will wear them into town.\nAll in all, at £19 these trousers really are a steal, excellent value for money.\nI rarely give five stars to anything that isn't of remarkably high quality because I think to do otherwise devalues the star rating system, however I have given these trousers five stars in the value for money category.",

					"Ordered two pairs unfortunately they were nothing like the photographs. They were not wrinkle free as advertised and the colours were not the same as the pictures. They were wide fitting around the legs and buttocks something I used to wear in the 80s. I rarely need to return anything but this occasion I had to. I am 38 inch waist and they fitted ok around the waist and length. The trousers were like the 80s flares :)"

					"These slacks literally came ready to wear.\n\nI didn't have to do anything to them but slip them on. They are comfortable and being wrinkle resistant they hold up over a busy day. I am up and down through the day when I am traveling for work, and these pants still look good at the end of the day. Love the way they feel and definitely like the way they look. There are several colors to choose from, and I have already order different ones to wear with various outfits.\n\nPerfect for life on the go. These slacks are what I need to stay looking and feeling good.",
					"These are great, if not perfect, dress slacks. I purchased the blue pair and they fit comfortable, give just enough room to be comfy and not too tight, but damn do they ever collect hairs and random bits and pieces of fluff. I have worn them a handful of times and had to run a lint collector over them twice a day to ensure I do not look like a homeless guy who walked through a petting zoo. I would not call these Wrinkle-Free but certainly Wrinkle-Resistant, by the afternoon of sitting at a desk you will have wrinkles.\n\nI have now added the grey and khaki pants to my closet as well.",

					"I love the look and the feel of these pants. They allow you to switch it up when it comes to your wardrobe, wearing them for casual to business casual.\n\nThe fit in the waist and the length is just what I expected. They are comfortable and affordable, which means that you can get several colors to go with your wardrobe and not worry about breaking the bank.",
					"Label says it is 60/40 cotton/poly. In no way is there any polyester in this pants. Within 5-10 minutes of wearing the merchandise, everything starts to balloon and lose it's shape.

					"Soft, durable pants that have faded beyond all reason. We ordered black and now they're gray. I only wash in child with Tide. My son wore them to work as a server and after a month he was told he couldn't wear them anymore. If color doesn't matter, the material had held up. Good for working where appearance doesn't matter.",
					"I",
					"I have to start with the price...wildly cheap.\nI usually pay £40-50 for my chinos from a well known online apparel company and while these trouser are not quite as good quality they are good quality especially for £19.\nThings I like,\nThe waist fit. They fit on the waist, not above and not below it.\nThe material. The material, while not top quality is good quality.\nThe overall fit. The fit is almost exactly the same as my expensive chinos.\nApart from the slightly less robust quality of the material, the only real differences are that the company from which I normally order chinos tailor them to my exact leg length and offer waist sizes from 32inches, rising in 1 inch increments up to 44inches. Then, for up to £30 more per pair you'd expect a little something extra.\nThings I don't like.\nBelt loops. There are fewer belt loops on these chinos but only one fewer so I suppose I am picking nits, although, I do think it makes a difference.\nTrouser cuffs. I don't like the jeans type of cuff finish. My usual chinos have traditional plain trouser cuff hems and I prefer them. Call me picky.\nIf closely looked at, in the places people don't see, these trousers are not as well finished as my other chinos and the material doesn't seem quite as heavy duty.\nI bought these trousers to wear about the house and in the neighbourhood to save my other more expensive olive green chinos but really, I have worn and will wear them into town.\nAll in all, at £19 these trousers really are a steal, excellent value for money.\nI rarely give five stars to anything that isn't of remarkably high quality because I think to do otherwise devalues the star rating system, however I have given these trousers five stars in the value for money category.",

They were wide fitting around the legs and buttocks something I used to wear in the 80s. I rarely need to return anything but this occasion I had to. I am 38 inch waist and they fitted ok around the waist and length. The trousers were like the 80s flares :)"

					"I ordered these in navy first to get a feel for the sizing, which is absolutely perfect. After getting them and liking them so much I ordered them in two other colors (grey and black) which were also perfect fitting. However after wearing these for work and washing them, the navy has faded terribly above the knee up to the waist and are unwearable without looking tacky. The other colors survived though but I will be very cautious when washing them in the future.",
					"Since my son is off to college in a few days, we ordered him a bunch of desperately needed new clothes. We ordered several different kinds of \"slim fit\" pants, including some designer ones that were MUCH more expensive than these.\n\nOf all the pants we got him (about 12 pairs and 5 different brands), the only ones he really liked, fit-wise, were these! They drape well, don't bunch in weird places, and keep their shape even when washed in hot water and dried at top heat. They look great on him, and the details, seams, etc. are very well made.\n\nCan't go wrong with these, is the gist of it.",
					"I",
					"I",
					"I tried a few different sizes of these trousers and eventually settled on 34/29. I initially ordered in my usual jeans size (32/30) but were way too tight in the waist and a little long in length. My advice therefore is to order your normal trouser size not jean size. There is no adjustment or stretch in the material. The light grey colour looks smart. They are made of an extremely comfortable lighter weight material - great for the summer. I am very pleased with these trousers and they are amazing for the price. The only negative comment I would make is that I would not describe them as wrinkle resistant. Highly recommended but be careful with the sizing.",
					"Really nice trousers for the price that fit beautifully. Better yet, they have the rarest of sizes - the elusive 35” waist for blokes who are happy to put it away at Christmas but aren’t yet ready to admit they’re 36s. The only issue - and it’s quite a big one - is that you cannot get the colour you ordered: I ordered navy… taupe arrived. I kept them as they are, as I said above, great trousers and - who knows? - Putin is being a muppet and I might need to go camo. I ordered navy again… taupe arrived… again. I sent them back, without any trouble, and ordered navy. It was a matter of principle now. Who wants two taupes? I wanted my mundane blue work trousers, not a colour that would have a colleague shouting, “All right, chinos?!” at me across the premises. Certainly not twice a week. Anyway… black has just arrived and I admit defeat. I’ll keep them though. As I have mentioned a few times, they really are very nice trousers for the price.",
					"Brought for playing golf in and therefore wasn't expecting anything special for the price. However really surprised when arrived (which didn't take long) as really nice quality. As advertised as 'slim', I thought they might be a little narrower bottoms but hang well and not a problem. Slightly tight around the waist although this might be down to me putting on some during 'lockdown'. Would suggest that if in doubt go for waist size an inch bigger.\nGenerally well pleased and would use again without hesitation.",
					"The build quality is good and length and waist are a good fit , however for me there no room to move, I have to get up and down a lot at work, and these just won't let me, seem to be a bit tight around the backside so they tug at you each time you move up and down.",

					"Pants work well as replacement for suit pants that were worn and match coat. Really surprised at the quality and material for this price, makes the suit a favorite again. Like some other reviewers said, if you are in between sizes order the smaller because they stretch up to 2 inches. I am a 37 so I ordered the 36 and they fit perfectly with the stretch in the waist band, actually better than the original suit pant because of the stretch band built into the waist.",
					"I",
					"So I opened up the package and pulled out the pants. They felt a little heavy and I looked in the pockets. Found a car key. Does that mean I won something?",
					"I'll keep this simple - the pants look professional, fit as I had hoped for my size (34X29), and are comfortable. The only thing I can't report on at this time is the strength of material or how long the pants will last as I've only had them for a couple of weeks. But IF they have some staying power, I will be purchasing the remaining colors. So far, so VERY good.",
					"A great buy. Can't go wrong for $25. A little baggy in the butt. I'd suggest buying a size smaller un utilizing the expandable waist. This might alleviate the baggy butt or you could have them tailored.",
					"O",
					"This pant was a great price and I was pleased with the value for the money spent . I ordered long and ended up having to hem them and I was ok with that. The waist band has a stretch bit in it that is brilliant. Helped with the fit!\nThey are not a heavy weave. Make sure you use a pressing cloth or you will get shinny spots on the fabric",
					"Glad I bought these pants! The stretch waist allows for a perfect fit (just in case you've gained or lost a couple of pounds). Nice material, good feel!",
					"Nice colour, but arrived crumpled with the pictured double crease ironed down one leg. Not what I expect on a brand new pair of trousers. I'm wondering if these were returns already worn.",
					"Was holding my breath when about to slip these trousers on as needed something quick for a funeral...but to my surprise they were perfect.\nI'd ordered a 38\" waist although during lockdown I'd put a bit of 'timber' on..but these were if anything a little generous (being stretch I think I was more towards a 39\" waist to be honest).\nLength was true to form also..order with confidence if like me you've grown to be an in-between size recently.",
					"These trousers are well-made and fit as advertised. I am disappointed though that they have a somewhat high gloss appearance. I had hoped for a matt finish. It is difficult to tell from the desriptions and the photos how the surface of the material will look.",
					"I’m an ‘inbetweener’; somewhere between a 34 and 36 inch waist. 34 is usually a bit tight and 36 too big. I also fall between two stools with leg length. Most manufacturers have 29, 31 and 33 inch inside leg. I fall between 31 (too short) and 33 (too long).\n\nWell, no need to worry when buying these trousers. With the slightly expanding waistband, the 34 waist fit perfectly. They are really comfortable. They do a better range of leg lengths too, so I was able to order 32 inch inside leg. The length is also perfect.\n\nI am really happy with my purchase and have already ordered a second pair as a spare.",
					"Well made trousers and fit is ideal for these lockdown woes, put a few pounds on no worries, waste expanded, don't get upset, these trousers will fit, would recommend this product"

I can't stand shopping in stores, so hopefully the new pants I receive in the new colors will be consistent with this pair that I purchased. So yes, I did buy them again ;-)",
					"Seemed like a well made product but I had to return it for size. Way too small in the waist. I am a 34/32 for the past 5 years. I had to double check to see if they sent the wrong size. Like I said, it seemed well made. I ordered a size larger so let's see how that one fits.",
					"I normally buy 32 or 33 waist and 32 long. I went with the 33 waist and these fit well. I ordered 34 length because I could hem them if they were too long. They were. A 32 long, which is what I usually wear, probably would have been perfect for a half to full break on my shoes.\n\nI have two complaints. One, these are 40% polyester - but I knew that going into them and makes sense for the very low price. My second complaint, which did surprise me, these chinos had a crease in the pant leg! Chinos should never have a crease in them! I'm going to try to iron them out, but wear them even with a bit of a crease, but with regrets. Not sure yet whether I'd buy another pair, but the price is amazing to try them out.",
					"Overall I think these are pretty good pants. The fit seemed right on at my standard size, the material is comfortable and seems durable enough... BUT they have one flaw that drives me nuts! The pockets are way to shallow. I have the standard fit ones as well and the pocket on those is much deeper. I can’t sit down with anything of reasonable size in my pocket without it falling out. My cell phone has hit the floor probably 10 times in just a few times wearing them.",

					"They length wise they were great. The waist size didn't fit my son but I knew it was a chance it wouldn't. We ordered several sizes. He fits the 32X34. He 5'11 and 135 lbs. Also he's 14 so to all you parents having a hard time finding your tall kids pants, these were good. He does not like skinny pants or jeans and these are great. They are straight leg but still relaxed. We kept the sizes that fit and sent back the bigger sizes. They only had 2 sizes in 32 waist so we had to get the rest from 3 fromOld Navy and 3 from Walmart. The price was good and the quality is good also.",
					"OK I'M DOWNGRADING MY ORIGINAL REVIEW....\nAfter just a few weeks they already they look old, FADED and very cheap.\n\nI've worn and washed these navy chinos about 7 times since I bought them a few weeks ago.\nThe navy colour has quickly faded in the sun and from washing.\nIn places they have turned a noticeably reddish-brown colour - really horrible looking.\nAfter 7 washes they were so faded as to be unwearable so this week I had to dye them navy again using fabric dye.\n\nThe synthetic fibers also makes them extremely scratchy and itchy in warm weather.\nAnd they also shrunk a bit after just 6 washes at 30 degrees.\nThey were £26 so lesson learned - you get what you pay for!",
					"These have turned out to be nicer than expected.\n\nI basically bought them as a very cheap 'wear a couple of times' pair of trousers, but I'm quite impressed with the quality.\n\nIn the photo they look very 'shiny' and plasticky, but in reality, they are 60% cotton and are indistinguishable from expensive Chinos. (Photo).\n\nThey are a lightweight material. So definitely more suited to summer than winter.\n\nI ordered a 36inch waist and 30 leg and the fit is good.\nThe legs are a good width. So many trousers these days have such thin legs, I can barely get mine in, but these are a good 'normal' size and happily accommodate my rugby player thighs.\n\nThe trousers themselves are nicely made, all seams and buttons are nicely sewn, with no hanging threads.\n\nOverall, for the money, these are great value, and I would happily buy again.\n\nI hope you found this review helpful.",
					"Not sure what I expected at such a low price, but pleasantly surprised. Material pretty good, workmanship pretty good and fit quite close. A lot more than I expected from the price and very wearable, even though slightly excessive in the rear fit area. All this and in odd number waist sizes too, how can I possibly complain. Bought another pair as well.",
					"Surprisingly good! Being of a certain age where skinny is just all wrong I gave these a go almost out of desperation but it but honest they're excellent.\nThe fit is neutral, especially for an ex-rugby player with decent sized thighs & calves.\n\nFor twenty quid, there a great deal.",
					"I don’t have massive legs but ‘skinny’ and ‘slim’ have become the bane of my existence when buying anything for my lower half. These are just perfect. Straight trousers with plenty of room for large legs. Material feels good. Wasn’t intending to wear these more than once or twice but I may have to invest in other colours now I know what they’re like. I bought these in the grey worrying that they’d be very light grey, but to my pleasant surprise they’re slightly darker than in the picture."

					"I wanted smooth, woven, lightweight cotton pajama pants. I could only find women's pajamas in flannel, knit, or fleece(!), mostly in cute novelty prints like kitties with santa hats and the like. These are plain cotton in, let's face it, consertvative prints of stripes and plaids. Which I like. I'm just above the upper height for \"normal\" women's sizes at 5' 8\"; these are just a bit long on me, coming to about the bottom of my heel. Fine for me for sleeping but shorter people will want to shorten them up a bit. I was expecting to have to sew the fly shut, but actually the one button keeps it closed modestly. They also have pockets. Now I can't imagine what men keep in their pajama pockets, but since women aren't allowed to have pockets in just about anything (world domination threat, perhaps?) I feel honored to have them. They fit just fine and have a cinchable tie at the waist if you need it. They're not exotic or \"sexy\" but are great to sleep in, pad around the house in, and help keep your legs a bit warmer when letting the dog out one last time before bed.",
					"I'm 5'10 and a 32 / 34 waist respectively and every thing I own is MEDUIM , so I ask you does this look medium? It's up to my chest and waist has 4 inches extra room . Thanks for the draw string. Only keeping because I need them as I am going to do some traveling and needed bottoms for the hotels but if not would have returned. Comfortable but NOT size accurate. This would be good on a 6' guy with a 36 inch waist. These are clearly cut a size LARGE . I purchased because of the reported accuracy of size i.e true to size reviews. Theses are 3rd ones that were not accurate.",

Color is thru, other PJs I have are white inside, these are not.\n\nI'm a slim 148lb 5'8\" male, usually wear a 31W30L levi's, and I fit the medium perfectly, couldn't be tailored to be more perfect.\n\nHas pockets, sewn-in string ties, and single button fly (some other PJs have a closed fly, these have a usable fly, very much appreciated).\n\nMaterial is like a sheet (more starchy feeling than say a Tee-shirt), washes and dries soft like 100% cotton would be expected to. Drying on low/medium heat has not seemed to cause shrinkage. (I avoid hi-heat).",

					"Love these - they're the best pair of loungepants I've brought in the last 7 or 8 years. I used to have a pair similar to these that i loved but can never find the similar pattern or comfort since, until I brought these. The only downside is I had to turn them up slightly as though I'm a tall bloke with a 32\" inside leg, they were quite long, but I wouldn't replace these as they are the best I've brought for a long time.",
					"This pajama was used. The previous owners credit card was in its pocket",
					"I'm really pleasantly surprised with these – they're well made, great quality and on the roomy side. They're pretty much exactly like a pair I bought from Gap, only the ones from Gap don't have pockets and were twice the price – lesson learnt. I'll be back for more when/if these wear out. Would highly recommend.",

					"Guys, I always try to be as critical as I can when I write a review, but I just cannot find anything wrong with these pants! I'm 5'10\" and weigh 225 lbs. and as a \"Gym rat\" I have a devil of a time finding dress slacks for work which will accommodate my 36 in. waist with my thunder-thighs (I never missed out on Leg Day). I was concerned with this when I ordered these pants, so I ordered one waist size larger than normal (I ordered 38 x 30's). The fit was perfect for me, as I like my pants loose fitting. Not only was there plenty of room in the thigh portion of the pants, but my private parts were not smashed or split down the middle by the inseam stitches like I get when I order Dockers or Land's End slacks. It seems that the fashion today for slacks is for them to ride low on the waist and have a slim, straight leg. Call me old-fashioned but I'm more concerned with comfort than style. The material was not skimped on, as these pants were thick yet breathable. They are dyed quite well, because after the first wash, there was no bleeding of color. I am extremely happy with my purchase and will continue to buy more of these!",
					"The 5-star rating is really more for the $20 price tag than anything else. They are truly a bargain, although if you're accustomed to wearing more expensive khaki-type pants, like Dockers for example, that are heavy cloth and have a hard finish with some sheen, you may not be crazy about these. I'm an attorney, and I often wear them to the courthouse with a coat and tie, and they look just fine. The pockets are deep and the pants are comfortable and well-made, just know that the fabric is somewhat basic. For $20, they're still a deal!",
					"I",
					"These pants are made of a coarse, almost rag-like material. They catch lint from the washer and dryer like no other clothes I’ve ever had. They look drab after the first wash. Are not permanent press, nor wrinkle-free. Finally, they run long in the pant leg.\n\nI never return clothes, but had to send these back. $20 pants are better quality from Marshalls, TJ Max, or similar.",
					" I purchased five pairs of khaki pants for school uniforms for my son. The fit was perfect, with room to grow and few wrinkles. I highly recommend these pants.",
					"I",
					"I knew I was taking a chance with these. Some reviewers praised the product, others trashed them. I needed new pants and didn't want to spend a lot, so I figured, \"what have I got to lose?\" I ordered two pairs, two different colors, but both the same size. I had hoped, based on the reviews here, that at least one of the pairs would work, but no such luck. The blue ones were ok in the waist, but for some reason were really tight in the seat. I am afraid they might split if I bend over. The tan ones (remember, same size, supposedly) I couldn't button up. Both are going back. I suppose I could order a larger size, but I shouldn't have to; I know what size pants I wear. Guess I will have to bite the bullet and order more expensive name brand pants.",
					"They fit, they're pretty well made, the price is low, they suit office work and casual settings, they don't look cheap next to my expensive trousers. They're just . . . trousers. Good all-rounders.",
					"I am currently on a weight-loss programme so I don't want to pay for any expensive trousers while I am on my 'weight-loss journey'. These are fine, because they are cheap and of reasonable quality. Two things: there is little substance to the waist-band, so you would need to wear a belt or experience rolling of the band. I also think that the sizing is a bit various, so I would tend to get the next waist size up.",
					"I",
					"Good quality for the price and good roomy fit - which is what I like. I can’t stand tight trousers!",
					"This item comes up slightly large. If a tight fit is required then order one size smaller than normal."

					"I was super excited when I first put these on because they fit perfectly and we're extremely comfortable however as soon as I put my hands in my pockets and then realized that the bottoms of the pockets were torn completely out I was very disappointed. They used the cheapest material ever created by mankind for the pockets. It's like bad swimsuit material that has been sitting in the sun too long.. I don't know why they would put such a horrible material for a pocket where you going to put keys and a pocket knife and change and all kind of stuff..",
					"I",
					"These pants are very comfortable. My first impression was that they were a perfect fit, amazingly flexible and comfortable, and the only issue was maybe how much of a lint magnet they were. I already had a lint roller handy whenever getting ready for work, so the lint was never a big deal for me. What did worry me were all the loose threads present in the pants. On the first pair I found many seams that just weren't the same quality between the pairs I ordered and at the end, I figured out that I needed a longer leg length and reordered.\n\nIn the next batch I received one right out of the box that had a pocket ripped in two sides. Interestingly enough, the pockets are made of a stretchy mesh that is sewn in the center and when you pull them inside out and tug on both sides, you can see the mesh struggle against that thread. This worried me with my other pairs when I inspected them and before another month had passed I already had another hole in my pocket where I keep my keys.\n\nIt's a shame because the material used in the pockets is very comfortable, like the rest of the pants, just not very durable or reliable. I believe the pockets in these pants will fail ages before everything else and I need to be able to rely on them not to fail me so I chose to return my third set of pants back in the end. I'd understand a pocket rip maybe after a year(s) of use but within a month of my purchase is far too flimsy.",
					"Okay, so I’ve reached the age (and, if I’m being honest, size) where a little stretch/flexibility is appealing. I recently discovered the American Eagle Extreme Flex jeans, so I set out in search of dress pants that had the same comfort and flexibility.\n\nI stumbled across these pants and decided to give them a try— especially at such a great price. I was not disappointed. They have a modem fit, and they’re comfortable.\n\nI will say that they’re not dressy. These are much more casual khakis, but I was able to pull them off by pairing them with a collared shirt and casual loafers in a business casual office.\n\nI often fear that “flex” pants will make me look like I’m wearing pajamas with pockets, but these don’t. They look just like a normal pair of casual khakis, but with MUCH more comfort. If Lee’s releases more colors, I’ll definitely order more!",
					"It is extremely rare to find pants that are 1 - comfortable, 2 - priced very well and 3 - have the length FIT! Most of my life I’ve had to alter pants after purchasing. So purchase pants for $40 and get them altered (max) $20 = $60 for 1 pair of pants. It’s hard enough competing against taller men for job, promotions, etc because humans always, instinctually, choose a taller guy because it signifies strength, leadership, etc. Then add “insult to injury” having a closet of altered pants that must get thrown away after “its time” because no one buys altered pants. Enough of that. These pants are nice enough to add a sport shirt and a jacket for any business casual event. Having a 28” inseam means I can wear them without altering. What an amazing concept! Not to mention these pants are comfortable, extremely comfortable. However, try these for yourself. Especially if you are 5’ 4” tall and COVID left you ~30lbs heavier. You’ll be surprised at the comfort and ability to dress up or down (polo, or simply a tee shirt, boots and a beverage).",
					"So I’ve bought these pants multiple times for work in the past. The quality has slowly gotten worse and worse. The first pair i got 2 years ago lasted me a full year, working as a mechanic I was very impressed, they also fit super comfy. The next pair I got was about a year ago, they were still decent but only lasted about 6-8 months before the back ripped at the belt loop area and outside the back pockets.. I figured it was something I did . So I ordered another pair yesterday.. these are COMPLETELY different. The material is MUCH thinner, the price has gone up ever so slightly yet the quality has dropped by a long shot. I have no choice but to keep them bc I need them for work but.. i have a bad feeling they will not last a month being so thin and scrappy stitching . Very disappointed as i used to love these so much.",
					"The waist is \"elasticated\" all the way round and not just at the sides so does not have that restricted feel when buttoning at the front. The amount of \"give\" in the waist is just perfect for comfort. The material is good quality with the pocket sizes being practical. I have ordered two other pairs of different colours. As these jeans are imported from the US delivery time is a bit longer but well worth the wait",
					"My husband and son are both engineers and they love the comfort and flexibility these trousers provide, they have also found that they were able to wear a size down for a more snug fit around the hips due to the stretch although their real size fits well with a slightly more relaxed look. They are smart and wash up well with minimal to no ironing required so I am happy too. Highly recommend this garment for work and leisure as they are smart enough for every day wear too. Excellent product, delivery and service.",
					"Product fits great, feels nice, good value for this brand, will buy again in different colours. Winner.",
					"Nothing to dislike. Great fit, comfort and value.",
					"Comfortable to wear although smaller size would have been better for me."

					"Pants work well as replacement for suit pants that were worn and match coat. Really surprised at the quality and material for this price, makes the suit a favorite again. Like some other reviewers said, if you are in between sizes order the smaller because they stretch up to 2 inches. I am a 37 so I ordered the 36 and they fit perfectly with the stretch in the waist band, actually better than the original suit pant because of the stretch band built into the waist.",
					"I",
					"So I opened up the package and pulled out the pants. They felt a little heavy and I looked in the pockets. Found a car key. Does that mean I won something?",
					"I'll keep this simple - the pants look professional, fit as I had hoped for my size (34X29), and are comfortable. The only thing I can't report on at this time is the strength of material or how long the pants will last as I've only had them for a couple of weeks. But IF they have some staying power, I will be purchasing the remaining colors. So far, so VERY good.",
					"A great buy. Can't go wrong for $25. A little baggy in the butt. I'd suggest buying a size smaller un utilizing the expandable waist. This might alleviate the baggy butt or you could have them tailored.",
					"O",
					"This pant was a great price and I was pleased with the value for the money spent . I ordered long and ended up having to hem them and I was ok with that. The waist band has a stretch bit in it that is brilliant. Helped with the fit!\nThey are not a heavy weave. Make sure you use a pressing cloth or you will get shinny spots on the fabric",
					"Glad I bought these pants! The stretch waist allows for a perfect fit (just in case you've gained or lost a couple of pounds). Nice material, good feel!",
					"Nice colour, but arrived crumpled with the pictured double crease ironed down one leg. Not what I expect on a brand new pair of trousers. I'm wondering if these were returns already worn.",
					"Was holding my breath when about to slip these trousers on as needed something quick for a funeral...but to my surprise they were perfect.\nI'd ordered a 38\" waist although during lockdown I'd put a bit of 'timber' on..but these were if anything a little generous (being stretch I think I was more towards a 39\" waist to be honest).\nLength was true to form also..order with confidence if like me you've grown to be an in-between size recently.",
					"These trousers are well-made and fit as advertised. I am disappointed though that they have a somewhat high gloss appearance. I had hoped for a matt finish. It is difficult to tell from the desriptions and the photos how the surface of the material will look.",
					"I’m an ‘inbetweener’; somewhere between a 34 and 36 inch waist. 34 is usually a bit tight and 36 too big. I also fall between two stools with leg length. Most manufacturers have 29, 31 and 33 inch inside leg. I fall between 31 (too short) and 33 (too long).\n\nWell, no need to worry when buying these trousers. With the slightly expanding waistband, the 34 waist fit perfectly. They are really comfortable. They do a better range of leg lengths too, so I was able to order 32 inch inside leg. The length is also perfect.\n\nI am really happy with my purchase and have already ordered a second pair as a spare.",
					"Well made trousers and fit is ideal for these lockdown woes, put a few pounds on no worries, waste expanded, don't get upset, these trousers will fit, would recommend this product"

					"I am what my wife likes to call...picky. About everything. I also hate shopping. I have been on the search for comfortable pants to wear to work for years. They either don't fir right, are uncomfortable, or are so baggy at the ankle I could fit both legs through. Gave these a shot and they are darn near perfect. Super comfortable. Fit well, and have a nice taper at the ankle. I immediately went back and ordered every color that was in stock. Found my new go-to pant, which means that they will immediately be discontinued.",
					"I'm a huge fan of the Levi's 502 Regular Tapered jeans (seriously, it's the only denim I buy anymore). So, when I saw these were on sale with the same naming convention (minus the explicit 502 designation), I was expecting the same fit. While they're certainly not skinny jeans, these are probably a midway point between the 502 Regular Tapered fit and the 512 Slim Tapered, which are too tight for my liking. So, be prepared that these will be a bit more snug than the 502s.",
					"I ordered these for work. Chinos are great for my line of work. Nowhere in the description page of these pants, does it state insulated or warm. Received and noticed a thick material. Read the label and it states \"warm.\" Further in it states \"to keep heat in.\" You see... I live in Souther Florida. Staying warm is not exactly an issue we have around here. Would have been nice to know in the description, that these are for cold weather conditions. 1 star based on lack of description and the fact I am being inconvenienced now, to return the item.",
					"These are my go to pants I have probably 15 pairs I bought over the last 2 years some I haven’t even opened the package yet. They fit perfectly on my body and that’s hard for me to find pants that fit. I carry my weight in my belly so while I am only a 34/30 it’s hard for me to find pants that fit. These are excellent and I have never received a defective pair. If I did I’m sure it would just be a fluke and I would just swap them out. So don’t worry about that the quality is excellent, yes they do fad after many many washings, that’s always been one of the downsides of Levi’s in my experience so get some woolite darks and wash them on gentle if you can and hand dry them and the color will last longer, if you have a color that’s not prone to fading like black is or it doesn’t bother you the quality is just fine and will hold up overtime",
					"I paid attention to this model of trousers, because I bought a year ago trousers of the same model from Dockers. I wanted to buy Dockers trousers of the same model again, but they were already sold out. The quality of the Dockers trousers was also excellent, as they are produced by the same brand. I was very happy when I saw the same model of trousers from Levi's. My expectations were met - the trousers are really of excellent quality, the size matches, the price at the discount is excellent. Thank you very much to the seller and the company for these trousers!",
					"Love these pants. Excellent fit and comfort. Great everyday and for traveling.",
					"The first chinos I've bought. Well definitely buy more in more colors. Soft and good streach.",
					"Fit is right on. The pants have just the right mount of stretch in the waist and in the crotch so when you sit down there is no binding or feelings of being restricted.",
					"Purchased 6 pairs of these April/May 2021 in numerous colours size 31x32. I was looking for a go to Chino pant which I thought they were until back pocket rips have now started to happen not even a year of rotational wearing.\nThe inseam length isn’t consistent, Some are true 32 while others are more 30-31.\nReally would expect better quality from Levi’s for a $70 + pant.... would of had a repeat customer for life if the quality was as expected.",

Al ser stretch, es bastante cómodo, el corte, aunque es regular, se ajusta muy bien en mi caso que soy bastante delgado (1.83 mt y 67 kg), la talla 31 de cintura y 32 de largo me quedó bien, quizá ligeramente holgada considerando que es tela ligeramente elástica, pudiera haber usado talla 30.",

					"These used to be the best trousers around. For years I would have multiple pairs in different colors that I wore for office work or going out. However, within the last year things have changed. About 8 months ago I bought a new pair to replace a pair that had worn out (after 2 years of use). I can only assume that the company changed the cut in order to save money. I was hoping that it was just that pair so didn't worry too much about it, until I just bought another pair to replace a different set that had worn out. The problem with these pants now are that 1) the distance between the crotch and the top of the waistband is at least 1\" shorter (causing pinching) 2) the length of the zipper is almost 2\" shorter (which causes concerns when utilizing the bathroom, can cause extreme pain when the tight zipper scrapes the manhood since the zipper is too short).\nUnfortunately I can't recommend these pants any longer, until the company remedies these concerns.",

					"These pants fit good and look nice. They're reasonably tough for everyday work pants I would think and my past two pairs have held up well. My most recent purchase however arrived with loose threads around the crotch region and are already unraveling. I tossed the package so I figure I can't return them and will see about taking them to a tailor. I mention this because it makes me worry that the quality assurance may not be as good as it should be. Be careful when you receive these pants and look them over well before tossing the package in case you need to return them.\nProbably won't order more of these and will look elsewhere in the future. I expected these to last longer than the $20 ones from walmart.",
					"I liked everything about this product, especially the no-iron feature. Somewhat pricey but worth the money.",
					"Since Sears isn't getting anymore inventory and are going out of business, I've been looking for my most favorite pant which are the David Taylor Pleated Extender Waistband pant from Sears. These are the same with a different label.",
					"I don't know what the deal is but I have another pair of this exact same item, just a different color and the other ones fit great. These pants are supposed to be relaxed. I like relaxed fit because I sit most of the day (I have a desk job) and they are loose and comfy especially in the crotch. When you are sitting for extended periods loose is better. This pair is tight always, sitting, standing, whatever. Seems like a quality control issue with sizing. Disappointed.",
					"I love these trousers.\nAfter BHS closed down I lost my source of desirable leg coverings and have been searching for a replacement. In these trousers I have finally succeeded in acquiring a long sought alternative.\nThe 'Active Waistband' cunningly hidden in these trousers still allows me to hold on to the illusion that my waist is 36\" (when 42\" is probably more accurate).\nThe pleats supply ample space for my ample buttocks.\nThe material is thick and of good quality. The zip and stitching, thankfully, appears to be strong and robust... a primary requirement!\nThese trousers are, to be honest, more expensive than other brands I've bought but the cheaper makes we're definitely inferior. With my Haggar trousers I can walk, sit, run (should I wish - which I do not), suddenly fall to the floor to do 20 squat thrusts (again, an unlikely event) with absolute confidence.\nI will be buying more... exactly the same... it's a man thing.",
					"I used to have all my trousers made to measure, retired now and thanks to Tony and Gordon’s raid on my private pension pots I’m making economies.\nI Loughton these trousers and they are almost as good a fit and quality as the ones I used to have made. I’m very impressed and with buy again God willing as and when. Highly recommended.",
					"I used to buy these from the US and Canada. Now being able to order and delivered to the U.K. is so convenient. I bought 3. The style, the fit and colours have always impressed me. The classic pleats make them comfortable to wear without making them look loose. Great buy.",
					"Most Chinos nowadays are slim fitting and very uncomfortable so to find these classic fitting chinos was perfect. Last time I bought such perfectly fitting Chinos was from a Saville Row tailor and I wore them for years. I have now bought 5 pairs of these Haggar Chinos, and wear them everyday! Strongly recommend them!",
					"Fairly well made garment but way way oversize. I have to have them tailored."

					"I ordered these pants for my fiance who 1) never wears anything but cargo shorts or sweats and 2) has athletic but very long/thin legs. THESE LOOKED GREAT! His nickname at the wedding became \"arm candy\" thanks to some very intoxicated bridesmaids checking out his butt. These fit and looked better than the $200 pants I originally bought from a nice department store. The fabric is lightweight but doesn't feel cheap. They fit perfectly and looked as pictured. The only bad thing was that the waistline kept wanting to fall to his hipline despite him wearing a belt. Would size down next time.",
					"Ordered as a last minute effort for my son for prom. Got a size 30x32 (wranglers he wears a 29x34) and they fit perfectly. Rested right at his hips and came just to the top of the shoes.",
					"I've been a 32 waist my entire adult life, but now I'm 61 and 32 waists are too tight (the thighs fit great) and 34s are too loose (mostly in the thighs). I appreciate a pair of pants that don't limit themselves to the traditional sizing practice. Go 33!",

					"This is my second pant, but its totally different from the previous one both in quality and size. Material is very thin and I ordered 31x30, though the label says 31x30, but it looks like it is 30x31 size, maybe they labelled it wrong without checking properly. I have returned the product.",
					"I bought these pants because I really liked the fit of an identical pair I bought a couple months ago. The ones previously purchased have the look and the CK name but one of the pants leg's hem at the bottom became unstitched and had to be repaired after a short while. The latest pair I haven't tried on yet but one of the legs is pressed incorrectly so the crease is off center about 2 inches. I'm hoping it can be re-pressed, don't want to hassle with returning it. Peace out Calvin! Mike B",
					"Material is good, size is right but there is just something \"off\" about the fit. It doesn't sit the same as some of the other similar CK pants I have and the material isn't the same. It's just a flimsier that the other ones I have and the pockets are crazy deep. For example, may Samsung Note sinks into the front pocket and I have to \"fish\" it out."

					"I ordered these in navy first to get a feel for the sizing, which is absolutely perfect. After getting them and liking them so much I ordered them in two other colors (grey and black) which were also perfect fitting. However after wearing these for work and washing them, the navy has faded terribly above the knee up to the waist and are unwearable without looking tacky. The other colors survived though but I will be very cautious when washing them in the future.",
					"Since my son is off to college in a few days, we ordered him a bunch of desperately needed new clothes. We ordered several different kinds of \"slim fit\" pants, including some designer ones that were MUCH more expensive than these.\n\nOf all the pants we got him (about 12 pairs and 5 different brands), the only ones he really liked, fit-wise, were these! They drape well, don't bunch in weird places, and keep their shape even when washed in hot water and dried at top heat. They look great on him, and the details, seams, etc. are very well made.\n\nCan't go wrong with these, is the gist of it.",

					"I",
					"I tried a few different sizes of these trousers and eventually settled on 34/29. I initially ordered in my usual jeans size (32/30) but were way too tight in the waist and a little long in length. My advice therefore is to order your normal trouser size not jean size. There is no adjustment or stretch in the material. The light grey colour looks smart. They are made of an extremely comfortable lighter weight material - great for the summer. I am very pleased with these trousers and they are amazing for the price. The only negative comment I would make is that I would not describe them as wrinkle resistant. Highly recommended but be careful with the sizing.",
					"Really nice trousers for the price that fit beautifully. Better yet, they have the rarest of sizes - the elusive 35” waist for blokes who are happy to put it away at Christmas but aren’t yet ready to admit they’re 36s. The only issue - and it’s quite a big one - is that you cannot get the colour you ordered: I ordered navy… taupe arrived. I kept them as they are, as I said above, great trousers and - who knows? - Putin is being a muppet and I might need to go camo. I ordered navy again… taupe arrived… again. I sent them back, without any trouble, and ordered navy. It was a matter of principle now. Who wants two taupes? I wanted my mundane blue work trousers, not a colour that would have a colleague shouting, “All right, chinos?!” at me across the premises. Certainly not twice a week. Anyway… black has just arrived and I admit defeat. I’ll keep them though. As I have mentioned a few times, they really are very nice trousers for the price.",
					"Brought for playing golf in and therefore wasn't expecting anything special for the price. However really surprised when arrived (which didn't take long) as really nice quality. As advertised as 'slim', I thought they might be a little narrower bottoms but hang well and not a problem. Slightly tight around the waist although this might be down to me putting on some during 'lockdown'. Would suggest that if in doubt go for waist size an inch bigger.\nGenerally well pleased and would use again without hesitation.",
					"The build quality is good and length and waist are a good fit , however for me there no room to move, I have to get up and down a lot at work, and these just won't let me, seem to be a bit tight around the backside so they tug at you each time you move up and down.",

					"I bought a pair each of regular fit, straight leg, zipper fly Levi's, Lee, and Wrangler jeans. The Levi's(505) were $40, the Lee's $32, and the Wrangler's $20. I washed all of them once, in cold water. They all fit about the same. The construction seems to be about the same too. All had 5 belt loops and reinforced the same points. They all were about the same weight denin. One difference I could find was that the Levi's had two rivets on the coin pocket while the Lee's and Wranglers had one rivet there and sewed the other side of the coin pocket into the main pocket seam. Also, the Levi's print your jean size on the outside label, while the Lee's and Wranglers do not. Both the Levi's and Lee have a double stitched external inseam on the inside of the legs and a concealed inseam on the outside of the legs. The Wranglers reversed this with the concealed inseam on the inside and a double stitched seam on the outside. The length of the inseam, compared to the advertised length, was pretty close, with the Lee's being the longest, and the Wranglers the shortest.\n\nOverall, I would say they all three pairs look like they will be fine over the longer term. So perhaps the price difference and your preference for brands might be the deciding factor.",
					"A couple of preliminaries here. I was friends with someone that used to work at a factory that would sew different name brands on the same clothing before even that factory went overseas. So I'm less addicted to the name of a product line than a particular product that is made at the time. I've worn well and far over a hundred jeans (dungarees for the less metrosexual of us over my far too many years). The only jean that I ever cried over was a very expensive Italian dress jean purchased years ago at Neiman Marcus. For those, they were the most elegant, comfortable and good looking jeans that heaven an Italian weaver gave to us. Ambrosia for the skin. For jeans under 90 dollars I've found in general that some of the Wranglers have been truer to size than most others. Yes, they are more coarse, and I understand that someone would be pissed that they received a jean that had a belt loop improperly sewed but this same person worked for a high end retail chain that had to return about 10% of the expensive high-end jeans for defects before being placed on the sales floor. Even then inconsistent sizing was an issue. Barring someone's fascination with the name of a clothing line, with few exceptions I really don't see much of a difference in quality between this 7 loop jean and a jean costing twice or more from other manufacturers including some (which is an irritant) from this same company. Unless someone is looking for a particular type of fit IMO the price justifies the purchase of this jean. I can beat the hell out of it, tear it up, put holes in it and not cry about it because 19 bucks for a decent fitting jean is CHEAP in this market. So what if there may be a defect in it. Return it and get another one. For me that's easier to stomach than having to return one costing much more and having to worry how much wear I'll get out of it. Cheap is good sometimes and not an exact indicator of quality. When I've done heavy duty work that puts more wear & tear pressure on the jean I've tended towards Carhartt. Great jean for wear & tear but an uncomfortable fit (for me) for every day casual & light work wear. As far as shrinkage goes, I wash all my clothing in cold water or dry clean it so I've never had a problem. How someone can wash anything cotton, whether Sanforized or not in hot water and not expect an issue is beyond me.",
					"I have purchased these in two colors and love them both. These Wranglers are heavy weight 100% cotton denim jeans. No spandex here! They are old school work hard and play hard jeans made the way denim jeans are meant to be made! Wranglers are comfortable, high quality denim with enough belt loops to allow your belt to work properly. They are big enough in the cuff to easily slip down over cowboy style boots without having to purchase a \"boot cut\" jean. The pockets are all deep enough to actually be useful. The cut and fit allow for all day comfort and ease of movement when walking, sitting, squatting, kneeling, and bending. Lastly, Wrangler offers enough colors to allow for personal preference, and also allow you to wear them as dressier occasion jeans when required. I used to wear the other two big name brand jeans but both started using thin denim with spandex in the weave, and they also deleted a couple of belt loops for some reason. Unlike these Wrangler Jean's they just aren't built for real work anymore. The other two makers lost a customer because unfortunately, as with most things nowadays, the price went up, and the quality came down. These Wranglers are my new favorites and as long as they don't change them they will have a loyal customer for life!",
					"I'm not sure who these \"Regular Fit\" jeans are intended for, but I think if you have any semblance of a butt or something other than pipe cleaners for thighs, I don't you'll be happy with these. These jeans had no room in the butt, through the thighs or in the crotch. And before we think that I had picked up the wrong size, I'll say that the waist was fine or every a little loose. Good news is that there's also a \"Relaxed Fit\" version of these jeans from Wrangler and they're the same $20. Those worked for me just fine (except they are a little long) and for $20 you can hardly go wrong. These are good looking, comfortable jeans offered in a number of different colors.",
					"UPDATE:\nI've been wearing them every day, and washing every other. Today, fresh out of a very hot dryer, they fit PERFECT!!! Can't tell you how happy I am with these jeans. At this price, I went and bought more, and perhaps my best friend ordered for me as well, since I hit my limit of three. (wink/nod)\n\nCan't find this size in stores, so I usually end up having to get them longer and hem them. I don't sew real good, so I have never had a Jean that fit perfect off the shelf. I am elated!!! Thanks Wrangler!\n\nI bought the genuine classic cut that is 100% cotton. I bought one pair just to see if they worked for me. I have worn them all day and they are quite comfortable. These aren't hip huggers, but they do ride low on the waist, as advertised. I'll update if something changes after a month or so.",
					"So, as I understand it \"Wrangler Authentics\" are not genuine \"Wranglers\" but a close copy. Though I know this only from other reports here. My experience of my first pair would tend to confirm this. They look good and feel good as Wranglers but shape and feel do not last as long as the \"genuine\" article. But the fit and cut are so close as to make little difference and the price makes them an affordable copy whereas the cost of the \"genuine\" article is currently out of my budget reach. So buy with confidence but remember these may not be the genuine article.....",
					"T",
					"very good quality fabric will stand a lot of wear,\nfit as expected, I'm not so sure as to the Wrangler tag as I have worn Wranglers as long as I have worn jeans but never the less worth the money.",
					"Can't get them up my thighs. No good if you're a rugby player. Surprised wrangler not up to usual stsndards",
					"Slightly longer than I expected (I only had to roll it up a bit), but other than that a great fit, using high quality material, and produced with excellent stitching -- a product built to last, even with everyday use.\n\nDelivery was faster than expected -- it arrived within a week, despite being sent from California!\n\nLooks good, feels good and seems durable -- GO FOR IT !!!"

					"I have been a huge fan of dockers dress pants for the last 10 years. However, I am suddenly finding it very difficult to locate 100% cotton pants. For some reason, many of the available pants and shorts seem to be made of a stretchy polyester blend material these days, Dockers pants included. I found the fit for the khakis to be great. However, the material feels ... well, like polyester stretch pants. I'll probably wear these until they get worn out, but will not be buying another pair.",
					"The material is very soft to the touch and the khaki material goes far enough inside the pocket that the white liner is barely noticeable when seated. My husband's favorite pants used to be Haggar Work to Weekend Hidden Expandable Waist, but when we ordered them recently, he noticed the liner in the pocket was white (not matching the color of the pants) and was very noticeable when sitting. Thus began the hunt for a new brand of expandable waist pants with pocket liners that were the same color as the pants, or at least not white and close to the pocket opening. As mentioned, these do have a white liner but with enough of the actual pants material going inside the pocket to make it barely noticeable. If this is important to you, another brand we just tried has a black liner which is much preferred over the white (Land's End Men's Comfort Waist) which also offers free hemming or cuffing in 1/4 inch increments.",
					"I live in South Florida where the heat and humidity are a factor in clothing selection. These Dockers are very comfortable for all day wear both inside and out. The fabric is a bit lighter than some other khakis but of good quality and holds up to heavy use and regular washing. I’ve had these for months and they still look as good as new.",
					"My husband needed new pants that would not pull on him and agravate a back injury. We tried several options, but h kept wistfully saying he wished he could use the pants do things now without hurting. And thankfully the great pants search is over. I ke he had worn for years. I looked and found these. The elastic in the waistband worked, and they have the feel of his favorites. He is able to putter around without hurting. And the great pants hunt is over. I should have checked the brand he loves first.",
					"P",
					"I have had good experiences with Dockers and these did not disappoint. They fit just as I expected from past experience, the fabric is soft and comfortable. The price is better than I typically find in the stores. The real advantage, however, is having the correct size delivered saving having to hunt through stacks at a store.",
					"Perfectly sized at true measurements 38 x 32. Nice relaxed fit for me, which is not easy, as I have a large rear end and thighs. The comfortable waist, neat and trim hemming and stitching, and attention to detail make the Docker's Comfort Khaki's a great addition to my business casual wardrobe.",
					"I bought these. They looked fine, but the legs were short. I got out a tape measure. Sure enough, they measured 1.5 inches shorter than the length specified on the tag. Since there is no cuff, there is no way to lengthen them. So I returned them for a refund. If I order Dockers again (I've never bought Dockers before) I'll by with longer leg length than I actually wear. -- And by the way, I ordered another pair of Dockers at the same time, but a different style. Same problem. They were made with the leg inseam short by 1.5 inches. So I think this was npot just a random issue.",
					"Delivered in time and quality as expected.",
					"Good quality fabric, comfort and a great fit - especially for men like me who are built with large legs. I bought 3 pairs, size 32. There is extra room at the waist if needed. The fit is looser thru the thigh, buttock and leg. I wear these to work, but would also wear them to dinner with a sweater or a sports jacket. The prices is exceptionally reasonable and the slacks arrived in less than a week. It's a bit risky for me to order pants online, but these did not disappoint!",
					"I",
					"I have ordered similar pants from Dockers.\n\nInitially, the were dressy enough to pair with a jacket. Unfortunately, I washed them instead of dry cleaning them.\n\nIn comparison to other pants from Dockers, these pants lost their crease and their \"new look\" quicker. I do not know how they would perform with special care.",
					"Don't purchase these pants. My husband has been buying Dockers for 20+ years and never purchased \"Dockers\" like these. The fabric is terrible. After wearing these pants to the office and washing them in our machine, the material started pilling, ripping, and unraveling. The stitching is very poor. The pants don't fit properly, with bagging in strange places. Our conclusion is that these pants are not real Dockers, or Dockers are suddenly making horrible, unwearable clothes. We sure hope it's the former."

					"I got what I expected. Buying my standard size they do fall to the snug fit side. But I do like a narrow drape. Good weight, not too stretchy, soft feel. I’m a stock 34x32 for years and I’ll be looking for these in a 35x32 for a little less pressure and showiness in the gender reveal region. I’m tired of the women falling all over me.",
					"Very good casual dress pant that fits nice.",
					"I'm 5'8\" 153... wear 32x29.\nDidn't like these at first. Compared to cotton (or high % cotton) twills, they look more polyestery, and the fabric is thinner. Also, though straight-legged, they are creased down the front (not \"pleated,\" as someone said). They wouldn't look right uncreased. So, on the whole, they look more like slightly relaxed dress pants. Also just the tiniest bit clingier than pure-cotton/high-cotton twills.\nHowever, they feel *great.* Very soft, not at all stiff. I think I could probably sleep comfortably in them (no plans to test that theory). Resist wrinkling well out of the wash, and reasonably well also during wear (probably not so well as pajamas).",
					"My husband has bought a similar straight cut Dockers in the past and was looking for additional pairs for his wardrobe so we bought these. Both pairs we received were very tight through the thighs -- you could see \"panty lines\" from his boxer briefs and his thighs are not overly muscular to cause this to occur. One pair of pants fit perfect at the waist and length and the second pair was slightly bigger in the waist. Needless to say, these pants went back.",
					"I've been buying Dockers from department stores for 15 years. The fabric these are made out of has the look, feel, thickness and durability of worn out motel sheets. I thought maybe I got a bad set but of the 4 pair I ordered 2 had holes in the by the 2nd wash, and not regular seeam holes these were right over my No No Square!\n\n3rd pair of pants made it to the 4th wash before the same sort of hole showed up. 4th pair developed some weird discoloration between the back pockets that made me look like a river of sweat was flowing through my canyon all day.\n\nI finally caught myself color matching my underwear to the pants before work...\nI left the pole behind in my 20s, I'm an adult now and I don't have time to bring my slacks to the underpants store every other week.\n\nI will never buy Dockers again.",
					"Perfect fit and very soft!",
					"Good quality. Sizing good.",
					"Ordered coffee bean, gray, navy and two blacks for my husband. The gray is a different fabric and has bit of nap to it. First, the wrinkles that were in the pants upon delivery were very, very hard to get out. I washed (cold water) and dried on low heat to help remove wrinkles but that didn't work. In desperation, I ironed them at the lowest heat I could to get the wrinkles out but it still left shiny spots on the fabric. The other colors are great, but I'd give these gray slacks zero stars if I could. Thoroughly disappointed in the heather gray Dockers!",
					"Out of date styling",
					"C'est le même nom que celui qu'on trouve en magasin, mais ce n'est pas le même pantalon. Je sais que Dockers a mis à jour ce modèle cette année, mais ce que j'ai reçu ne correspond ni à l'ancien modèle, ni au nouveau que j'ai essayé en magasin.\nLe tissu est *beaucoup* plus mince que le nouveau modèle. Il y a aussi un pli sur la devanture du pantalon (ce qu'on ne trouve pas à ma connaissance sur le Easy Khaki qu'on trouve en magasin), qui dénature le modèle.\nJe l'ai porté 2 fois, et il présente déjà des traces d'usure à la fourche.\nJ'ai aussi l'impression qu'il est plus \"baggy\" que \"droit\" à la jambe.\nIls ne sont pas inconfortables, seulement ce n'est vraiment pas ce à quoi je m'attendais. Je suis très déçu.\nJe me suis demandé si c'était un vrai Dockers... et je suis très surpris de voir autant de bons commentaires ici.",

					"Trying to find anything to fit a tall (30'x36\") slim, athletic teen is next too IMPOSSIBLE. Anything long enough is cut to fit someone about 300 lbs. As a 6'1\" competitive swimmer, finding good fitting pants (or shirts) is nearly impossible. Not every person that is tall is enormous! Some guys are tall and athletic but still slim. Sheesh.\n\nFinally, pants that fit a tall athletic frame without looking like:\nA) a garbage bag you have cinched at the waist or\nB) pants that can double as body paint because athletic thighs do NOT mix well with skinny pants.\n\nSo, no more shopping around. It is Goodthreads for the win. Thanks for finally getting it right for Moms of teenage and college athletes everywhere. I am spreading the word.",
					"Alright these pants were close to being great. They fit well, were comfortable, and had a modern slim fit. However, all day long people kept noticing what looked like a rip at the right pocket. Turns out it is just poor stitching. The inside \"slim\" tag was stitched with a white thread, which is visible from a side profile view. I didnt even notice myself in front of a mirror but am glad a few coworkers pointed it out. The rest of the stitching has thread the same color as the pant. As a result I am returning.\n\nPros:\n-material is not too thick and not too thin\n-material has a little stretch to it, but doesn't loom stretchy. The waist even gives a little.\n-comfortable, stylish, fit as described\n\nCons:\n-white pocket stitching is visible from the side and looks like a rip. It is very obvious and sticks out like a sore thumb.",

					"I bought these simply because they were cheap and I needed something ‘khaki’ in a hurry. They arrived, I washed them, and then wore them on a 10-hour flight. They were hugely comfortable, didn’t look like a mass of wrinkles at the end., and the fit is great. No complaints.",
					"I’m really impressed with these pants. I expected to have to return these pants. But I saw them at my doorstep and tried them on right away. The waist was spot on with my regular pant size. They look like good quality. We’ll just have to put them to the test of time. My only gripe, and it’s just personal preference, but I wish the pant legs tapered more below the knee. The thighs are fitted but when it gets below the knee it straightens out. I do have skinny legs and small calves, so for me I like the pants to be more fitted below the knee. All in all I’m pleased with my purchase.",
					"The pants have a nice, soft finish and fit well. Worth the money, thanks!",

					"way to generously cut to ever be described as slim-fit (I suspect these are designed for the US market where slim is the same as chunky in the ROTW). I put them on, took them off, put them back in the packet and had them dropped off for return within an hour of receiving them.\nwaste of time, money and effort",
					"T",
					"So happy with my first 2 pairs that I ordered these my third pair. Good variety of colours. Comfortable, fit well and look more expensive than their very reasonable cost.",
					"Just received trousers today and very impressed. I didn't expect too much for the money, but have to say the quality is very good. The waist is generous and I will have to use a belt with them, but in my opinion that is a plus! They have a bit of stretch in them which as I bought these for bowling is perfect when bending down to bowl. A big thumbs up from me!!!"

					"My 14 year old likes these. He wears the xs. He is 5'4\" & 117 lbs. He likes that the pants are the more modern cut (the kids call them joggers).",
					"I love these joggers. They are very soft and comfortable. I’m 5’3 195lbs. I purchased a small but they were a little to tight. The mediums are perfect. Loose but not to baggy.",
					"Fit pretty nice. More on on the baggy side which I I like. I’m 5’3 about 130 for reference.",
					"Maybe this is because my expectations were so low to begin with, but I these are fine sweat pants. I secretly judge people who leave the house in sweat pants (except maybe for the gym or to go play sports outside) so I'm not wearing these around throughout my day, these are what I put on after I get home from work and errands and I'm getting ready for bed. They are soft and warm, and I like that they aren't so balloon-ey like normal sweat pants. If you are buying these as a fashion statement to be worn around outside the house then this review isn't for you, but for others, you really could do worse than these sweatpants.",
					"These sweatpants had all the makings to be perfect, can’t be upset about the price(sub$20). The quality feels good, time would tell if they pill or shrink but initial review seems like they are a good quality.\nWhat is causing me to return:\n1. I am 6’ 170, the sweatpants are about 3” too short especially if you sit in a chair they become high ankle pants.\n2. Although they appear to be elastic at the waist and ankle they are not. The waist as shown is a draw string (not a preferred style for me, but to each their own.) Also the ankles are not elastic which makes them feels loose and not conducive to sports activities or general wear (in my opinion.)\n3. I would prefer zipper pockets to keep items from slipping out of the pockets.\nUnfortunately I will be returning these. If you are looking for a phenomenal pair of sweatpants I would recommend searching Under Armor Threadborne, I do not believe UA makes them anymore which is a travesty but they are an excellent pair of sweatpants. Hope this review is insightful.",
					"I love the materials. I love the pockets. I love drawstring. I feel like these pants were built for a huskier person though. The small fit me perfectly in the waist. The medium fits nearly perfectly in the inseam. I wear 31\"x32\" pants.",
					"The item quality itself is okay. Think of it as what you’re paying for. It’s thinner than h&m joggers but thicker than those Walmart joggers.\n\nIf you like a fitnent where it is right, I recommend getting one size down or even two...! They run very loose. The length is also very long, I’m thinking 32” inseam",
					"So let me be upfront. The only reason this had 4 stars instead of 5 is because they showed up with a hole in the crotch already. I'll be returning it.\n\nExtremely comfortable and for 15$ you could do a helluva lost worse.\n\nPlease make more larges in gray and charcoal please!",
					"Definitely not the grey I’ve given up on life boomer sweatpants. Comfy, not a baggy rear end, tapered legs with cuffs at the bottom, and decent pockets.\n\nI’d probably wear these in public and not be embarrassed. Decent pants to wear with your girlfriend when you take her to McDonald’s and then show her the usefulness of an 8foot long box f150.\n\nIf you are over weight do not buy these they will be skin tight on your bigger legs.\n\nI’m 5 11 and I wear a 32 34 pant and these go down to my ankle tastefully. Just a heads up if you have normal or short legs",
					"The quality is good and they feel comfortable, leg length was perfect and not to baggy at the bottom which is good, the issue was how big they were jeez! they were about 2 sizes bigger than expected so although I do recommend them I suggest downsizing even if you are a big guy or gal if you order your normal size they will bury you!",
					"I",
					"",
					"Having purchased a black pair a couple of weeks before and was very happy with the material and fit so I thought I would jump in again and order another pair of black joggers.\n\nHowever, the black was out of stock so I ordered a charcoal pair ( and paid an extra £4 ) assuming the quality would be identical-it wasn't!\n\nThe charcoal is much lighter and the weave is more fluffy which means they are not as warm as the black pair.\n\nI only say this to warn people in advance in case they make the same mistake.",
					"Nice jog bottoms with a slimmer tapered leg with good size side pockets, I ordered the 34-37” waist for my husband expecting that size to be a large but after I’d placed my order it stated a size ‘medium’ in my confirmation details. I would say they are not a 37” waist slightly smaller, they are a tie up waist too not elastic. I’d recommend going for the next waist size up for a true large size, especially if you are a 36” waist and prefer a looser fit. Nice denim blue colour marl fabric though with a soft fleecy lining. Leg length on the standard is just about a 31”. If I buy anymore I’d definitely get the next size up for my hubby."

					"There are a variety of types of Dockers pants, so part of my dissatisfaction may be with not understanding which is which. However, these pants were VERY different from ones I have previously purchased. First, the material changed after I washed them the first time to a \"fuzzy\" feel instead of just plain cloth. Then, the length shrank about an inch after couple of washes (I have never had a pair of Dockers pants shrink that much). Frankly, it almost felt as though these were some sort of cheap knock-off brand being sold as Dockers.",
					"F",
					"Don't know if the quality has suffered due to not being made in the US but Dockers are not what they used to be. I remember Dockers made of heavy material and very durable but this product is nearly paper thin. I expect it to be worn out twice as fast as the good ol' pants. Maybe its the type of pants ordered but there seems to be no way to buy pants like the good ones anymore. Is there a way to know/tell on-line before buying if the pants will be more heavy-duty/ durable? Price was right and look nice enough but as I said this pants will not hold up very long.",
					"Yet another product “improved” to the dissatisfaction of long-time customers. What happened to the 60/40 cotton/poly twill D3 Classic? This new soft, drapey, sanded fabric is limp and picks up lint like nobody’s business. This is not a classic, khaki-style pant. It’s now more like a wool dress slack. If I’d wanted that, I’d have bought genuine worsted wool. If nothIng else, at least they haven’t managed to screw up the Classic fit, so there’s that. Disappointed.",
					"Very nice fit, and the fabric is soft. I am undecided if I'm going to purchase these again as I've worn them less than a month, and one of the leg seams is already tearing. To be more succinct the fabric appears to be tearing at the seam. It's stretch fabric, well, apparently is doesn't stretch very much. These fit me fine when I'm standing, and moving around, but sitting, for some reason, is causing them to stretch, and it looks like they will fail soon.\nI'll be looking for other options, I guess. It's sad because I really want to like these pants.\n\nEdit: The pants are now torn a little after right at a month of wearing twice a week, but these are non-returnable. It's sad because my initial review was so much higher, and I had planned on buying two more pair this month, but now I have to try to find a different pair of pants.\nI am in 58 waist, but I've come down from 62, and am losing weight after changing my diet. I plan on losing more, but I can't afford to pay $40 for a pair of pants that don't even last a solid month.",
					"These slacks fit exactly as hoped. They are attractive. The zipper and the fasteners work well and I like the style. I can’t speak yet to durability but they look as though they will last a good long while.",
					"Seeing some confusion in other reviews, there are a few styles of Dockers. Signature is the standard Dockers. This product is the \"Easy\".. Easy are a softer lighter material, and a bit looser fit. Easy are a little cheaper (price wise, quality still good). I love them, comfortable, durable, my last set lasted 2 years/twice a week and another pair is holding strong at 15 months/twice a week.",

					"This is the first time I bought a pair of pants online without trying it. I am a bit disappointed. I've put it on right away when I got it. It's more like a straight casual than a slim-fit. And the bottom is not tapered. Very wide on the legs and thighs.",

I ordered the 31's and could fit a fist between my waste and the waste band; with a belt there was so much extra fabric in the back of the crotch area i could wear them to smuggle bags of sacrete out of home depot; and these are \"Slim cut\". My girlfriend couldn't help but laugh at the flap of material just between my legs that looks like a extra storage pouch. I've never bought such poorly cut jeans.",
					"I'm short. Between 5'4\" and 5'5\", to be exact. In general, I need my pants - especially those which will be worn in a professional or formal setting - to be of the \"slim\" persuasion so I don't look like I'm wearing my older brother's hand-me-downs.\n\nAs you can see in my attached pictures, there's no discernable difference between this line's \"slim\" and \"straight\" fits; the waist is identical, the thigh/leg area is identical, and the bottom is identical. The \"slim\" fit is in no detectable way more \"slim\" than the \"straight\".",
					"Being a short guy, it's not often you can find inseams that really fit you. Often I have to take it to the tailors. They also have every single size which is also rare. Normally you have to go up two sizes. The material is ok. I just got it and haven't washed it yet nor wore it around much. I was just stoked by how well they fit! I say the material is only ok because it's pretty much standard like you would find anywhere else. It's not crappy but it's not super fine either.",
					"M",
					"Great pants. Great fit. Fit just right. Tailored leg (not baggy, not skin tight). Not tight anywhere if you get the right size. Good, comfortable cotton. The pants also don't make a lot of noise when you walk, like pants sometimes might. Great price. It's also very nice they were made in Bangladesh, and not a certain other Asian country that might want to cause problems for America.\n\nAdvice: get one size (2\") bigger at the waist compared to your jean size, keep length the same. They were tight when i bought my regular jean size, but fit just right one size bigger.",

Will wait until it comes down again before purchasing another pair.",

It’s very comfortable.\nShape and look is similar to a $100+pants you buy from Express but the zipper is longer so it’s easier access for when you need to go peepee\nWorth every penny.\n\nCons\nWaist was one size too small. I usually wear 32. I ordered a 33 because I started gaining weight. For these, I need to buy 34. Debating on whether I should return them or not. Over the course of a work day though, it didn’t bother me.\n\nGo get ‘em",

Unfortunately, these are significantly baggier and the fabric feels thinner/cheaper and more prone to wrinkling.",
					"I was pleasantly surprised by how well these pants fit! Many times I have problems with pants that are too tight in the thighs, or alternatively baggy in the calves and too long. But these were good for more casual pants. Of course, if you like things to fit perfectly they'll probably need to be tapered a bit. I'm a bit on the short side (5'8\") and have a stocky build, for reference.",
					"You know how pants usually have 2 buttons on the front, one main button on the front of the waist and a 2nd button slightly to the left of the 1st which locks with the 2nd button hole to secure the fly in front when opened (guys, you know what I'm trying to describe). Well, that missing 2nd flap button & button hole is a real spoiler when you open the zipper, the piece of waist that doesn't hv that 2nd button, always pops out. This is an uncommon design flaw in my opinion. Hence the poor rating.",
					"In the dryer, make sure there is something wet/moist when drying pants+. A wet washcloth or sock makes steamy heat and tends to lessen wrinkling. Then take out the pants while just a little moist, spread out and smooth with hands and hang on hanger that grabs cuffs (no folding). Not perfect, but avoids ironing!",

There is so much give in the waistband that you could have two Thanksgiving meals and have room to spare. (Do not try at home)\n\nThey're not baggy-looking however, the fabric kind of conforms to your body without being skin-tight.\n\nOverall the fit is awesome for someone with average-sized legs. If you're going for a more skinny fit you might have to try another style.",
					"I",
					"This jeans are awesome. As a big guy, most of our jeans are a loose or comfort cut so we get this ugly straight down elephant trunk look with no shape and no style. THESE JEANS ARE DIFFERENT!! These jeans have shape. They’ve been made to actually fit a big man. There is also a gusset in the crotch to help reduce wear and tear and ripping. It’s the only Jean I wear. I have 5 pair. Best jean you can get for a big guy. Yes I like these better than my true religion and lucky.",
					"My husband’s family is cursed with thunder thighs and large booties. When I found these, I also had his regular jeans in the cart and he immediately took the old ones out and ordered these. I didn’t understand his excitement until they were delivered. He ripped open the packaging, put them on, and it was all over from there. Not only did he order 2 more colors but he posted it on the family fb page and all the males ordered pairs. They now have a running joke about how AMAZING these jeans are.\nFor sizing, my hubby ordered his regular size and that was perfect.",
					"Wow - I am so happy. Perhaps even giddy. I have found jeans that accommodate my squat butt without looking dumb. Not only do they fit, but they are comfy. Very comfy. The waist and legs both stretch, but don’t feel loose. I did a few squats with these and they didn’t restrict me, or at least much less than regular jeans. I would be stoked if these were in the $75-100 range. For these to be $35 is awesome. I have never worn jeans to casual Friday because I’ve frankly never found them more comfortable than khakis. Never again shall I not wear these when I have the option.",
					"Over the years I put on a lot of weight, then last year went on a diet and lost around 75 pounds. I had been wearing sweats mainly since jeans cut into my waist. I tried a few brands of jeans, but legs were always huge and looked terrible. Decided to try these in 42, my waist is 44, but these fit great, so will last as I lose some more. Leg fit is like a normal jean, not like elephant legs, waist stretches and feels like good sweats, love these jeans. Will wear at work tonight and if all is as good as it is now, will be buying more. Update, still love these jeans, so comfortable, a 42 waste will fit up to a 46, no cutting into your waste and really stretches a lot. I bought 3 of these jeans now, after washing they were same as before washing. By reading reviews and looking at each jean color, make sure you pick the ones with correct material, many will fit different. Some are very stretchy and some less, the ones with most cotton are less stretchy.",
					"M",
					"The stretch on these is really excellent. They absolutely fulfil the requirements of gents with bigger than average legs. They are even more roomy than I expected though and you could go down a size compared to other jeans that aren't designed for large legs, including the waist. There's a LOT of stretch. I will be buying again but a size smaller as the fit is more baggy rather than having a tapered or tailored fit.",
					"It always throws me how jeans made for men have actual pockets!\n\nSoft and comfy jeans.\n\nReally great quality.",

					"I ordered these because I couldn't find anything I liked during a shopping outing.\nWhat I like:\n* They are long, but fit perfectly. I'm 6'1\" wear 40/32 pants and these are long enough that when I sit, they still come to my ankles\n* Very soft and comfy\n* They are warm but not too much. I'm not a fan of super heavyweight pants. I wouldn't want to exercise with these, but they are perfect for lounging around.\n* Waistband is sturdy (about 2inches tall)\n* No back pockets.\n* Two front pockets with no zippers\n* The color is uniform and muted\n\nWhat I don't like\n* The pockets are too short. I'd greatly prefer the pockets to be able to hold an iPhone without it sticking out or worrying about it falling out when I sit. Another 2 inches of depth in the pockets and I'd stock up on these\n* As another pointed out, the tag on the back aren't as soft as the main material. It looks easy enough to remove if needed (with a seam ripper) but they don't bother me that much.\n\nPlease make the pockets deeper, but I'm very happy with my pair!",
					"I don't think there's a better sweatpant on the market for $15. They're simple in terms of style, but well made, comfortable, and the size/fit as described is correct. They certainly exceeded my expectations for the price!",
					"I",
					"These are heavy weight sweats. They are much better quality than I expected. Seams are serged as I expected, but the operator made sure the threads were nicely aligned with the edge of the cloth and straight. I don't know sewing terminology so I'll drop in a couple photos.\nThe pant legs are open, not elastic, which means I can wear them when I'm running errands.\nThe deep side-seam pockets are reinforced at top and bottom.\nI'm ready for winter workouts!",
					"M",
					"Impressed with these well made sweatpants. Nice medium weight, nice medium gray, good front pockets, good stitching and hang well. 40 waist is often between XL & XXL so we went with the XL and it's a great fit. Not baggy anywhere, just loose enough to be comfy. Wish they had a back pocket. I knew they didn't so it's ok. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair when we need them.",
					"I prefer guy sweatpants over women's sweatpants because they're comfier & thicker. I read in so many other reviews that these are good quality & very warm. After wearing them, I 100% concur. Thick material, soft fleece, and super cozy. I love them. I'm going to sleep in them tonight and lounge in them tomorrow. Maybe I won't ever take them off. Who knows.\n\nOrdered an L - they fit, but they are a little tighter in the stomach & hip area than I would have liked. I will probably order an XL next time around. In saying that, if you want to achieve the ultimate-cozies & you prefer ultra-baggy sweatpants like I do, I would recommend ordering a size up.\n\nDo I recommend these pants? Obviously. They're wonderful.",
					"My waist is 36 so I ordered the Large. They were 2-3 inches too long for my 30 inch inseam, and baggy in the butt. So I hemmed them instead of returning them. Not the best idea I've had but I wanted some sweats for the gym right away. They are heavy weight material and not suitable for summer use so I'll wait till next winter. Never again will I order pants that only indicate one measurement. Duh.\nI gave them a 2 because the fabric and workmanship was a good value. But they just don't fit.",
					"I",
					"Great for lounging around the house, I wouldn't wear them out as I am not a chav, nice quality and good fit I am 6ft 36waist and large is perfect size. Great for house or gym wear!",
					"A",
					"I picked up a medium and noticed it kept drooping down on the rear so relegated those to PJs and picked up a size small instead, which were indeed smaller, almost too small for my waist, but still liked to droop around the butt. Not enough to fall down (the waist overall was tight) - but bending forward slightly will reveal your builders crack.\n\nIt's odd, they are not loose, and I've tried two sizes. I think they are just not very well designed and don't have enough slack at the back to accommodate bending. So fine for lounging around the house, but not so great for exercise and I wouldn't really recommend them for jogging unless you are okay with pulling them up a lot or wearing a long jacket.\n\nFor reference, I'm a size 29-30 inch waist.",

					"Worst pants ever. I had them less than two months and the waistband fell apart. I have worn Dockers product before and was satisfied. These pants were awful. I am a restaurant manager so I wear my clothes hard and wash them frequently and as I previously stated I have had good luck with Dockers. I admit this is the first pair of Dockers I have bought in a while. The quality has gone down. Way down. Trust this review and don't waste your money on this product",
					"These slacks are almost ideal. They are very soft and comfortable, with just the right blend of cotton and polyester. I'm not a fan of synthetic fabrics, and these have a very natural feel to them against the skin. The expandable/stretch waist and cuffs make them near-perfect.\n\nSadly, the slacks suffer from having a very cheap, flimsy zipper. Not nearly long enough, and difficult to zip up and down, with a tiny clasp, made me feel like I was wearing slacks made for a child rather than an adult. Two weeks in, the clasp to the zipper hasn't broken off yet, but I'm expecting it to, at any moment. I'm also wondering if I apply WD-40 to the zipper, if it will help it zip up and down more smoothly, rather than the tug of war I go through with every use. In addition, I've never worn pants before where the front pockets are firmly placed at the side of the legs, rather than at least somewhat near the front. A bit bizarre, but not a deal breaker. The poor zipper, however, would prevent me from recommending these slacks or purchasing them again--a quality, durability fail.",
					"After a few wears and one wash could put it in the trash. The used material was very thin which should have been the first give away, after one wash the material near one front pocket showed a wear of a kind I only have seen with Jeans where they do this on purpose with laser machines. So I will never but this online ever as had I known the quality would have gone down so drastically versus the older ones I purchase a long time ago in a store, I would never in a million years made this purchase. This should have been a hassle free thing but the Fabric was simply subpar , I would not even call it quality, not sure what one would call such a poorly made product,, So DO NOT Buy you will get burned. Product in the trash and money gone.",
					"I'm going to have to gush. Over pants, no less. I've been wearing these daily for one month and six days. These pants are fantastic. They quit the dryer ready to wear (no ironing required), they look hyper professional, they fall well across the crotch (no tents, even when seated), they are super soft, and they come in a variety of fabric weights.\n\nThus far, I own two Dark Charcoal Heathers (Stretch) and one pair of the Dark Pebble (Stretch). The dark charcoal are a heavy weight (flannel-esque) fabric that kept me super warm commuting over winter (40s F by day, 10s F by night). The dark pebble are lighter weight, if still substantial, and should serve well across the summer (80s and 90s F by day, 40s and 50s F by night). The pants are roomy, and the crotch is cut high enough, my thighs don't \"meet\" each other when I am on the run (a pet peeve of mine in other makes; going thigh-to-thigh irritates me when both thighs are mine).\n\nI have had no breathability issues to date across long meetings in over-warm boardrooms, in either pair. It is (literally) 83 F in my office as I pen this (if a lovely 58 F outside), and the dark charcoal remain comfortable, temperature (and every other) wise. As such, I am inclined to test them (dark charcoal) across the summer; they look that sharp.\n\nI am a 38x32 at present, and the fit was true to size for all three pairs that I've ordered; again, thus far. I see myself buying new and backup colors as soon as my lesser pants are decommissioned. I can grab stuff off the floor without having to readjust and re-tuck after, and I can sit (seemingly) indefinitely with no waist pressure/discomfort. I will continue to purchase and enjoy these for as long as they sell them (and do not alter them). Even if my size varies over time, the magic waistband stretches 2-3 inches without deforming the lay of the pant. Moreover, it shrinks a little beyond the listed size, not just grows, so I can continue to enjoy them whatever direction my diet and exercise bear out.\n\nBottom line... Love at first sit !!!",

The pockets are large but convenient. The waist band is comfortable and adjustable on the inside. I have 5 pairs that have lasted over 6 months now. Great for actual chefs/bakers.",

Material is breathable and seems durable, time will tell.3 pockets total. Was so skepticle that i ordered 2 different pants but these came first and I’m not even worried about the other pair.",
					"The pants fit perfectly. Very Pleased with the purchase!",
					"Nice fit, baggy enough for the kitchen hustle but not baggy to the point they look funny. Pockets are a nice depth and the pants will take a beating, tough fabric but not scratchy. Although, they are a bit stiff until after a couple of shifts and washes. Would buy again.",

					"Take extra care when washing these. We followed the directions on the tag and they shrink excessively. You may want to order an inseam size larger. As you can see...one pair hasn't been washed and the other in comparison is about 2\" shorter! Almost unwearable after two washes.",
					"I read other reviews who said this specific Docker pants run short, so I bought 30x30 black pants for my son who is 2 inches taller than me. The reviews are correct. I have a picture of 10 year old classic Docker pleated classic fit 30x29 beige pants (only washed and worn a handful of times because slightly long for me). You can see the new black pants after washing only once are 2 cm SHORTER than the old 30x29 beige pants. That’s fine with me since I am short and will probably buy the 30x29 inch pants for me.\nFYI. The pants are a little stretchy since 92%cotton and 8% elastane (maybe that’s why it is a little shorter and also slightly tighter at the waist than my old 100% cotton Dockers.\n\nFYI. Length Measurements. Length. Inseam\nPre wash. 39”. 29”\nPost wash. 37.5”. 28”",
					"Alright, so I'm an IT guy, and a flexible one at that. I'm constantly squatting, bending down, crawling, and getting into some not-so-accomodating places. These pants are GREAT. The stretch that's built into them feels great when you're doing a lot of work as they don't feel stressed, too tight, or like they're going to rip. I've worn down and destroyed a lot of pants through constant wear and tear, and I've been looking for a pair of khakis that are stylish, fairly slim fitting, while still allowing a high level of athleticism without falling to pieces. These have done exceptionally well and I cannot recommend them enough to anyone who needs a good pair of khakis that will let you get down and dirty without breaking.",
					"I hate buying new pants. It's the worst. I also hate pants in general. I find them very constricting - I move around a lot, am very flexible, and like to have a solid range of motion. Pants always seem to stop me from moving my legs the way I want to. Well, without ripping the pants. I saw the \"Smart 360 Flex\" on these pants, read a little about it, thought they sounded good, and figured I'd give them a try. I ordered them, they came in, I put them on, and I promptly ordered three more pairs in different colors. These are the most comfortable dress pants in the history of time. They look both from a distance and upon closer inspection like normal dress khakis. But they feel like you're wearing pajama pants. You can move however you want in them and they stretch very naturally to your every movement. They fit perfectly as expected, not too tight, super comfortably, and move however you want. All while looking perfectly professional. Plus, they have one of the smoothest zippers on the fly ever. Love a smooth zipper fly. Hate clunky ones that lead to you standing at a urinal, zipper gets caught, you have to move it back and forth a few times to free it, meanwhile you look like a creep in the middle of the bathroom. Never gonna happen with these pants. They also have a weird security pocket on the side of the right pocket. For people that use them, I'm sure it's a great feature. For people that don't (like me), it's practically unnoticeable so it's a non-issue. And far better than those stupid security pockets that some pants have inside the regular pocket, like a pocket in a pocket, which always just led to my keys getting stuck in them and me having to turn out the entire pocket just to get them out. So this is a much better solution.\n\nLong story short - Professional looking khakis that feel like pajama pants. Best damn dress khakis ever.",
					"The first time I wore these, they were pretty good. They don't have a crease, wrinkle somewhat easily throughout the day, and are slightly baggy, but overall very comfortable. After a wash, I noticed that they shrank a little. Care instructions say tumble dry medium, and I dried them on low. I figured a small amount of shrinking on the first wash was okay/normal, but they shrank more and more with each was since then. I've washed them five times, and it is now to the point where they are 3-4 inches shorter than when I bought them. They were very comfortable, with nice, thick stretchy fabric, but it is to the point where I can no longer wear them because they are so short. Very disappointed with this purchase.",
					"These pants are the most comfortable pants you will wear for the price. The stretch when bending and moving makes these pants an excellent choice for someone that has to dress business casual, but occasionally needs to be able to do physical tasks.",
					"These pants feel comfortable and wash well without the need for ironing. Err on the slightly long side as these will shrink a bit upon washing and drying.",
					"These pants are very comfortable, they have a little stretch to them adding to the comfort. Better price here than at Dockers website.",
					"Has a stretch in the fabric.",
					"Awesome product, excellent fit.",
					"Pretty expensive pair of pants. They are about half the weight of an older purchase of dockers that I have. So I think they’re just a cheap cut of the same product maybe go direct to the manufacturer or other sellers",
					"The material is different from those sold in Canada. The size of one of the pants is not correct. The label of the pants shows 33\" (which is not available in Canada) and it is actually 34\". I need to sew the waist button 1/2\" closer to make it 33-1/2\" which is OK now.",

I tried a few other brands in \"slim\" and they were always tight in the hip area, while regular slacks were too baggy in the butt and hung too low in the crotch. These are a nice \"in between\" because of the more modern cut I'm guessing?? The weight of the material is on the lighter side which seems perfect for hot days. I haven't washed them yet, so I can't speak to how well they fare in that department.",

					"I'm not normally a fan of dress pants...but these are insanely comfortable. The \"modern dress fit\" definitely makes them a bit tighter...but that's fine since I often wear skinny jeans, anyway. They are also surprisingly stretchy...which is definitely part of the reason why they are simply so damn comfortable. I'd happily own and wear 10 pairs of these.",

					"First off let me say... this is the only product I have worn to work for the past 3 years.\nOriginally the product was fantastic!\nThe material was soft and comfortable, the fit was great, I could not have asked for more.\n\nThen, approx. 6-9 months ago I ordered more. This is when the disappointment began, they were sized small and itchy.\nVERY itchy, and uncomfortable to wear, walk, and sit. Did I mention they were now VERY itchy?\nIts like wearing wool that has been dried too long, scratchy, awful.\n\nI thought possibly it was an anomaly, I ordered 7 more pairs in the last two weeks (this time one size larger than previous)\nThey fit similar to the original meaning now you really need to order one size larger than expected.\n\nthe fit (one size larger) is good, however these may be itchier than the previous.\nTHEY ARE AWFUL. I have to put on lotion to keep the itching down.\nI just purchased 7 pairs and I'm considering throwing them away and buying Dockers.\n\nThe reason I originally loved the ORIGINAL product was the material was wrinkle free, very comfortable, and the fit was great.\nThe new ones are just awful.\n\nHaggar should be ashamed. They really are that bad.\nClearly they have gone cheap on the material and manufacturing.\nthe material is definitely different, lower quality, and uncomfortable.\n\nWay to ruin another good thing.",
					"I have worn this particular style of pants for four years and thought I had found a good product.\n\nBought a pair three weeks ago. Still good.\n\nBought a pair last week. washed and put on to wear, expecting they would work like they have for past 4 years. I went to fill the pockets and found that Haggar had shortened them by approx. 2 inches/5 cm (they were 12 inches deep from the waist band - these are 10 inches deep). The pants are totally unusable for office/business casual wear as stuff now sticks out of the pocket!\n\nHUGE disappointment as I thought I found a manufacturer that knew pants have to have useable pockets. Haggar has seemingly decided that saving two inches of material in the pockets is more valuable than making a useable product.\n\nI gotta go find somebody that knows how to make pants now that Haggar doesn't.",
					"I ordered the pants long, and had to shorten (I had to guess the length when ordering). I must say: I love these pants! The fabric irons and sews beautifully. The drape of the fabric is good. When I finished hemming, they looked professionally done. I like the expandable waistline. These were for my son's graduation, and he looked very nice. Thank you! I highly recommend these pants.",
					"I love the fit and color of these pants. The ones I normally buy are no longer produced so I was looking to replace them.\n\nHowever, these pants collect lint like it's their job. I've tried washing them in hot water, cold water, this dryer sheet, that softener, this detergent, dryer balls, rinse with vinegar, etc. If I'm looking for pet hair or lint the dryer didn't catch all I need to do is look on these pants. I could make a whole other pair of pants out of the lint these things collect.\n\nI don't know what it is, every other dryer and pair of pants combo I've ever owned don't do this.\n\nThe pants are great I just can't keep them clean.",
					"We had to switch from jeans to a nicer style. These are light, cool and the toughest pants I've ever owned. They last me 3 times as long and look good the whole time. They never fade. I'm a big guy and would blow the crotch or pocket corners out of my jeans all the time. Not these. I even fell and hit my knee on a fan blade once and it cut my knee but barely put a nic in the pants. I don't know how! I've been buying these for 4-5 years. It's all I but now. I've only ever wore one pair out. I get new ones if I put a sharp tool in my pocket and tear it or something. They are tough and save me a lot of money.",
					"I have worn these pants for many years. They fit as expected. The adjustable waist band makes them very comfortable. They look good and last a good lifetime.",

					"I have purchased several Haggar trousers in the past and these are good and comfortable. I ordered 2. The first one arrived on time and was perfect.\nThe second dispatch was delayed and it was not the material I had ordered. Fitting is not good.\nI would prefer to purchase from shops rather than on line in future.",
					"The product fitted fine around my waist. However, they were just huge around the calf/ ankle area and looked ridiculous. Not sure why they are designed for people with abnormally massive ankles?",
					"The cut of these trousers are awful. Nothing like the picture or description. Very unflattering. Only redeeming thing is the material. I should return, but stupidly took the labels out",
					"The package came torn, both outer and inner package. I asked the delivery person, he said not sure. But the pants thankfully was ok, no torns visible, just dirty. Little too large, especially around the leg area, would probably need slight tayloring. But overall beautiful material. Would buy again, always a gamble buying online."

La tela no es ligera pero para temporada fría va bien aunque para calor creo que sería muy caliente. La bolsa interior del pantalón para guardar el celular tiene un diseño vertical que creo pone en riesgo tu teléfono para una potencial caída. La calificación de 4 estrellas es por la gran calidad de la marca pero creo que este pantalón puede ajustar para una persona delgada y no para una persona de talla regular o atlética ya que es más skinny que slim.",

					"I bought 50s and they were too tight. Then I tried 56 after estimating the size exchange rate between these and normal pants. When the 56x30s came in it was clear the legs were 34\" or more even though they are labeled as 56x30. Also, the elastic on one side wasn't sewed into the pants where they are supposed to attach to the inside of the waistline. It seems as though these are made with high quality material and I can tell that probably most of the pants that come off the line are good pants. But I suspect that maybe the not so good ones get sold online to people like me who, rather than waste my time with returns, just learn their lesson and don't buy them anymore. There's always a market for suckers that haven't learned a lesson yet. But that's online arbitrage for you. People pick up garbage locally at a discount and sell online for a profit.",
					"These pants are poorly made. They haven't even been washed yet and the buttonhole is fraying, as is the waist band. I have worn them twice. I have worn Haggar khakis for years and never had this problem. Also, they have only one button, no French fly, and no inside closure of any kind. The legs are cut too narrow and the wallet pocket is so small that my wallet gets stuck. It seems as if every possible step has been taken to reduce manufacturing cost without consideration for durability or fit.",
					"Haggar brand seems to be holding their high reputation with this new \"Men's Big & Tall Iron Free Premium Classic Fit Expandable Waist Pant\", based upon only one day use.\nThe fit of both waist and inseam are accurate and quite good, including ample room and/or stretch for a big man's fanny and upper legs.\nI was surprised that given only a few minutes unpacked from the wrapper, these pants managed to smooth out virtually all of their initial wrinkles without steaming, spraying with wrinkle release or any other form of help.\nThe pant fabric has a smooth finish and appears to do a good job of shedding dust, static charged particles and many other common causes of lightly soiled clothing that courser pant fabrics seem to collect quickly.\nThese pants may cost more than their bargain price competitors, but the excellent look and feel of this Haggar product, plus what I anticipate as longer useful/handsome product life, make this a wise purchase with ample benefits.\nTRY THEM . . . I AM CONVINCED YOU WILL LIKE THEM, TOO !!!",
					"I work receiving and have a lot of walking to do and most importantly need something durable. These are very comfortable and move with the body very nice (bending, squatting). I also stay cool all day long compared to when I wore jeans.\n\nThey sit just below the belly button perfectly all day. I’m hesitant to wash because I don’t want to have the color fade so I will be dry cleaning them every so often but usually use a wet rag to wipe off dust after the shift.\n\n48x28 but I should’ve bought a 46x28 because of the stretch in the waist. Well that’s why we have belts.",
					"I was in need of a pair of dress pants quickly. They came hemmed to my requested length. I was really pleased how they fit me. Very happy about the iron free ability of these pants. Washed them, took them out of the dryer, shook them out, and hung them up. Perfect.",
					"Husband loves them and got them for a great price at Christmas time. Just wish they had more colors to choose from and when I looked just not to order them they was marked way way up in price. Holding out for them to go back down and gonna stock up lol.",
					"These took a little longer to get but they arrived on schedule. They fit well, the stretch feature gives some room for fit. Since you cant try them on it's good to know you have some room for size.\nYou know some brands vary. But the fit is good! they hold the press throughout the work day.\nI'll order them again.",
					"I'm a bigger guy, 6'3\", 280. These pants fit very well without being baggy. A tiny bit stiff on the material but that will likely soften with wear and a washing or two. Very happy with this pant.",

					"Finally! Every summer for the past few (maybe several) years, I've gone looking for some linen or linen blend dress pants. Something I could wear to the office on these 90+ degree days here along the Gulf Coast. And every year I would get frustrated and give up after sifting through an abundance of baggy, drawstring-waisted, beach pants. I might find one or two offerings from some high end brands, but at eye-watering prices.\n\nNot this year, though. I finally found exactly what I was looking for: cool, comfortable linen blend pants that are appropriate for work and pair well with a sportcoat or blazer, and which are not priced like a new suit.\n\nFit: slightly tailored but without being tight. I've got somewhat thick thighs for my waist size, which means I often try on pants that fit beautifully as long as I remain standing and then become uncomfortably tight around the quads the moment I sit down. These pants pass the all-important sitting test, which so many others fail. The legs hang fairly straight below the knee with a medium break at the ankle when ordered in my usual length. After a wash or two, I did notice a small amount of shrinkage, but not enough to significantly alter the fit. For reference, I am 6'0\", 185lbs and typically wear 34W x 34L, which is what I ordered here.\n\nColor: I have two pair, one in navy blue and one in \"natural\" linen. The natural pair is a fairly light color, darker than off-white, but not by much, and certainly lighter than tan. Think unbleached paper cone coffee filter. The coloring has a little bit of natural variation. The navy pair, however, has an even and consistent color throughout that tends to mask the texture of the fabric unless seen up close, so the pants aren't obviously linen when seen from more than a few feet away.\n\nCare: Since these are dress pants, you won't want to go with the crumpled look of casual linen beach wear. And that means you do have to iron them a bit as they'll come out of the dryer looking a little shriveled on the legs. A few touches with an iron set on high is all it takes to flatten out any major wrinkles, though, and the rest seems to fall into place.",
					"These pants are light and airy, just what I needed for attending outdoor summer weddings in 90 degree weather. The fit was just right. They fit just like a pair of dress pants, not baggy like some of the beach style linen pants. After one washing there was no noticeable shrinkage, but of course they are linen and may at some point and came out very wrinkled. A few minutes with an iron while they were still damp and they are good to go. I typically wear 36-38 waist pants depending on brand and style (OK and how much weight I’ve gained or lost too), and 32 inseam. These hit the tops of my shoes just like my dress pants, and the waist is true to size to me.",
					"T",
					"I've been a 32 w 34 l for many years, the first pair I ordered was much too small at the waist and much too long in the inseam. Happily, I had time to order a pair in a 34 w 32 inseam that fit just great. These slas are well made and look great, I would not hesitate to purchase them again.",
					"Bought a complete white suit with pants for my husband and unfortunately the pants that came with the suit didn’t not fit him due to his thighs bit bigger than the average. So I went ahead and found him these pants and he loves it. It fit perfectly. The color was just right. Only thing is you can see the pockets through these pants. But other than that, highly recommend these pants.",
					"I",
					"I really like the fit on these pants since they aren't baggy and shapeless. I needed them for a beach wedding and they are a nice fit and look semi-dressy. I'm 5'10\" tall and 190lbs. I prefer the linen blend to prevent excessive wrinkles and for more shape.",
					"I",
					"Generalmente soy talla 32 pero como era para uso de playa pedí 34 y fue una excelente talla, cómodo y resistente pero deja respirar.",
					"",
					"I purchased these pants for my brothers wedding\nThey were perfect.\nThe wedding was in Mexico in June and as u can guess it was extremely hot!\nThese linen pants kept me cool and comfortable\nFor the ceremony right up until the reception.\nGreat pair of pants.",
					"Not for casual wear. The waist band is rigid and unforgiving. Do not buy.",
					"Like the blend of the linen, polyester and viscose as it eliminates many of the wrinkles expected with linen pants. Like the waistband and belt loops for a dressier look.",
					"The product arrived on time. The pants looks great and the waist is just right. The legs are a tad too long but can be easily altered."

					"Love these pants! I ordered the 34x32, and I'm 6'0\", and around 200 lbs. They are super comfortable and stylish, hold up well against wrinkling, are cool and breathable, and the fit is spot on. My weight fluctuates a bit from 195-205 every few weeks, so having a waistline that expands and contracts is fantastic. It keeps me from having wasted clothing just hanging in my closet. I ordered 2 of them, and they are identical. Color and fabric has held up perfectly after 6 months of weekly machine wash on cold/tap cold and machine dry on normal. Never need to iron them, so long as you take them out of the dryer promptly and hang them up properly. My only gripe (which is minor, at that) is the little pocket inside the front right pocket. I imagine it's for pocket watches. I tried keeping my Zippo in it, but it's a pain trying to get it out. A watch on a chain would probably come out easily. Definitely recommend these pants!",
					"My husband loved these pants. I am used to purchasing trousers for my husband and can spend $200+ on one pair. I thought I would give this a try since they were free returns. I couldn't imagine that a pair of trousers could cost under $30 and look lovely, as well. I was wrong!! These pants looked fabulous. The material was lovely and fit him nicely. They won't shine like a designer-made or hand-tailored high end pair of trousers, however, they look lovely and are well made. I haven't had them laundered/dry cleaners, yet, so we will see how they stand up to the demands of a busy executive and entrepreneur.\n\nUPDATE: It’s been over two(2)years now and these trousers are in fabulous condition, still!! Had them to the dry cleaners and perfectly laundered!! Enjoy!!",
					"This is the quality material, workmanship, comfortability - and affordablity that pants used to have. I work at a hotel doing room-service, and have been in hospitality for 40 years. I haven't been able to find pants like this for well over a decade. IF I wear high-end or expensive slacks, I have to deal with the hastle of drycleaning. These pants are comfortable, have a permanent crease, & do Not wrinkle (with reasonable care). (In other words don't just mash them in the bottom of your closet under 50 lbs of dirty clothes). I can wash them 3 times a week - or more if need be. Just tumble dry until \"almost dry\", and place on hanger - good to go. I am going to order 3 or 4 more pair. If you need pants that are practical, yet look VERY respectable -- these are the pants you need - hands down!",
					"WOW! I LOVE these pants. I should start by saying that I don't really need the expandable waist feature, but I spend about 8 hours a day sitting at a desk and another 2-3 walking from meeting to meeting so pants that \"adapt\" to my posture- HUGE PLUS. They fit perfectly- absolutely true to size. I have thin legs, but there is plenty of room for more generous stems. Material, although 100% polyester, feels exceptional. Very \"soft\" and fine. It does not have the feel of polyester that will pill and look shabby in a month. Pockets are deep. Belt loops, seams and three-point fastening waistline (2 buttons and hook) are all of excellent quality. Another plus- You might have to crumple them under a car tire for a week or two to make a wrinkle. I love cotton and wool, but the ironing- ARGH! ...and the cost for wool- double ARGH! The Repreve Stria pants truly resist wrinkling and creasing. HOWEVER-- Be careful to NOT tumble dry if you wash at home. They will wrinkle in the dryer. Hang dry instead (my recommendation).\n\nI now own these pants in five different colors and wear them at least three days and have been doing so for well over a year. ALL are performing beautifully! No pilling. No fading. No failed stitching. They look near-new even after dozens of machine washes.\n\nBottom Line- if you can get these pants for under $20 like I did, but 10 pair! At $35, buy 3 or 4 staples and I believe you will love them as I do.",

					"This is a very well-tailored, traditional-fit, lightweight pant which is exactly true to size and length. It may be too lightweight for northern climes in the winter, but an excellent choice for year round use south of the Mason-Dixon on all but the coldest days. The tailoring is crisp, well-sewn, and the fabric has a lovely \"hand.\" The Haggar \"expandable waist\" is invisible and allows for the occasional fluctuation in girth. I purchased two pairs for my father (93 and fashion-conscious), in black and \"medium grey.\" The black is as you would expect; the grey is not-so-medium, but tending toward the darker tones--almost, but not quite a charcoal. Still a very nice color, just darker than expected. The pants washed perfectly per the instructions and needed no pressing if whisked immediately from the dryer and hung. (I'm careful not to overdry polyester.) I think this trouser is excellent value for the money and Dad was happy.",
					"My husband asked me to order these because the weather here in Florida was a bit chilly and he wanted black slacks to golf in. Well, if you know Florida weather, in the few days it took for these slacks to arrive, it warmed up. Regardless of that, they fit really nice and the material is great too. They'll make great slacks for us to dress up a bit for a nice date night. Would recommend and would buy again.",
					"This was my 5TH order of these slacks.\nI'll never buy from anyone else.\nThey fit perfectly!\nWrinkle free!!\nI'm a single man, and I don't like shopping or trying stuff on. With these, I don't have to worry about the fit. They're perfect.\nI'm ready to fill my closet with more.",
					"Good quality and very comfortable.",
					"First class product",
					"I bought it during Prime day & delivery was as expected.\nI took a risk of buying clothes online for the first time because I am very particular about the texture and the way the colour on the clothes gets presented. A bit particular about.. not too dark, or fancy, should go well with other light or dark clothes I have.\nI loved everything about it after it arrived. The texture, the designs, the belt space.. just was perfect. I am medium built and, unfortunately, found the ankle stretches of the pant to be more like baggy. I don't need such for office use of trousers. Had to return it but would definitely recommend and buy again, at a smaller size this time) if the price comes down to something similar to Prime day price)",
					"I hope I don't wear these out too soon. The feel is fantastic, the style is great and the fit was perfect. Despite being shipped in a plastic bag, these were ready to wear as soon as I opened them. They will be great for travel as well as every-day office attire.",
					"Nice pants, haggar has become my go to dress pant for work. The color is nuteral ,works well with white shirt and brown dress shoes, after wearing expensive dry cleanable dress pants at work for years I've gone to the washable dress pants. To be honest I find these look as good and at the end of the day I can through in the wash, ready and fresh with a nice pleat . I never thought I would wear synthetic pants but these look and feel more like a wool pant. I can recommend these, don't think I would wear a suit jacket with but with a dress shirt they work great."

					"I have to say this was concerning. I received my new pants hoping to wear them to work the next day. After opening not only are they the wrong size but they are significantly worn. The Levi's printing in the inner waist is peeling and the size tag showing 34x30 (I ordered a 36x34) but was almost unreadable because the pants had been worn a s washed so many time. Now I know why these were labeled as \"Last Pair\"",
					"I had bought these same pants for my husband a year ago in several colors and he loved them! Comfortable, able to move, good fit, etc! HOWEVER, these pants shrank so much in the length over time, that they all became too short. SO these a replacement that are in the next length( 2 “) longer to accommodate for shrinkage. But he did like them so much that I ordered at least another 1 pair in khaki. They are soft nice material and can be dressed up or down as necessary. Note that they are “ wrinkle resistant” not “ no iron” so they may need touching up with an iron.",
					"I bought these for my boyfriend. He loves the fit and they’re exactly what he was looking for. I don’t know if it was the product itself or the way it was shipped, but the only complaint would be the putrid, rancid urine smell wafting from the fabric. These pants smell like someone wore a urine soaked diaper underneath them for a month, then stuffed them inside a sealed plastic bag for ‘freshness’ and shipped them to my house. We’ve washed them twice...alone...with a gallon of tide each time to no avail. Buyer beware. If you open that shipping bag and black out from the smell of petrified piss, just get up off the floor and immediately print your return label. Washing, soaking, scrubbing, praying....that smell isn’t going anywhere. Just get your money back and don’t be stupid like me by thinking you can wash it out. Best of luck!",

					"Being a fan of the Lee brand all my life I needed little persuasion to purchase these trousers. They fit exactly as they should, they look right and are so comfortable they are always my first choice to wear out of the wardrobe. They are also great for wearing whilst playing golf and other activities due to the comfort aspect. I have bought several pairs of these trousers and have been slowly discarding others from my wardrobe. You simply cannot go wrong with these trousers.",

					"Purchased pants during early lockdown and intended to use them for the golf season. As a result did not wear them before end of May. I bought two pairs, blue and khaki. While the fit was as expected and are comfortable, wore and washed them twice only to have them, the blue pair, discolour and fade to a reddish tint on the thighs. Seems like a dye issue to me. Now the return window has elapsed and I’m unable to get through to the seller to have them replaced. Most annoying really.",

					"Unlike other brands where \"relaxed fit\" indicates a roomier cut, Carhartt has used it for their scrawny guy fit. \"Paging Mr. Pencillegs, Mr. Nobutt Pencillegs, your pants are here...\"\n\nI _really_ want to love these pants, the fabric, color, pockets and construction are all great, but the blasted relaxed fit with it's shorter rise and narrower legs completely ruins them. Despite fitting fine at the waist, the crotch is way up in my business and the seat and thighs are like sausage casings. Sitting, crouching or bending are nearly out of the question, with seams digging into places where you really don't want things digging in. I'll be returning these to get something like the B11 or B151 models that actually fits right.",
					"Until now, these pants had everything I want in a pair of pants, but the pair I just received have placed the front belt loops about 2 inches too far back so that the pants sag below the belt in front. I have no choice but to wear them today and hope for the best, but beyond this emergency they are useless. Carhartt was a brand name I trusted, but now, Carhartt is another brand I hesitate to buy online, and I pretty much only shop online. I am disgusted with the lack of reliability in either thoughtful design or quality control, whichever is responsible for this relatively expensive fiasco.",
					"I",
					"First, it's Carhartt. So at least there is ONE brand that has consistent fit. It's heavier and more durable than most brands, which is why you buy Carhartt. That being said, anyone that buys Carhartt knows that they use \"true sizing\". Just like their \"Original Fit\" Shirts, these aren't for you if you favor fitted shirts and skinny jeans...THANK the gods. Your regular fashion jeans size is not going to fit you in a Carhartt pair of pants. If you are actually a 46x30, order a 46x30. Not the 40-42x32 Wranglers. (Cuz that's what I wear, ;) That extra 2\" in length for a Carhartt will look awful and be very long in these pants and that 42 waist will be very very tight.\nSo, these pants ( I ordered the Dark Khaki, 46x30) have a mid rise waist with plenty of room in the leg (clearly, I'm a big guy) and are perfect in length. They are well constructed and the pockets don't show the liner ( I hate that in a pair of pants). They pass the \"office\" test, if you're like me and can't wear 'Jeans\" to work, but they are plenty durable for field work (if you're like me and have to go back and forth to the job site) So, all in all, a win. ... now if they would just drop the price of the other colors for us fat dudes, I'd be happy.",
					"I was a little sceptical of the look of the material, afraid it was going to feel like wearing a schooner sail for pants. While thick, it is still soft and comfortable. I'd kind of like them to go full casual and lose the little pocket, but that said, they feel like I'll have these around for a while.",
					"Son loves these because:\n-He has short, muscular legs and a trim belly and butt.\n-Most other pants with room for his big thighs (weightlifter), have far too much room in seat and waist.\n-Carhardtt tough so they won't rip in the crotch from his active work (bending, lifting, carrying, squatting)\n-They look VERY nice -wear for many situations...great cloth and drape\n-We bought extras!",
					"Excellent quality and comfort.",
					"The way these pants ended up fitting me is actually not easy to explain in 2-3 words. I've been buying 32W-34L pants for the past 10 years, but after reading the reviews on these Carhartts, and concluding that I could very well be a half inch shorter than I was when I was 40, I decided to go with 32W-32L, and they fit perfectly in the length. The waist was actually just about right, but what was odd was that the butt and thighs were tighter than I've ever come across in what are supposed to be \"relaxed fit\" pants. They're not uncomfortably tight, and they did loosen up a bit like cotton is prone to do after a day of wearing them, but I would definitely not describe them as relaxed fit.\nFrom a quality standpoint, I thought they were very well made. The fabric is reasonably heavy, but doesn't feel like you're wearing pants made out of canvas. The stitching is tight, no loose threads, the zipper and top button are high quality.\nThe phone pocket is actually quite useful, though I use an iphone SE so I can't comment on how large a phone it would hold.\nAll in all, I'm very satisfied with these pants, and I certainly can't complain about the shipping- I placed my order on a Friday morning, and by Monday afternoon they were at my door, and that was with regular shipping.",
					"Now that I finally received them they are definitely as advertised. I don’t know why people were saying they fit small. 33 waist is accurate, but the length is a little longer. If you are usually a 32 length you’ll want a 30.",
					"The only work pants I trust are the ones made by Carhartt, I work in a Sawmill in all types of conditions. Quick wash and dry, they look like new!! They fit properly where it matters most! True fit sizing, these ones are great for Summer and fall application",
					"Strong material build as usual with the Carhartt brand. But the relaxed fit is a bit on the large size for a 34 34.",
					"Fit small on waist & leg width. Typically where 34/36”. Fit was more a 32”",
					"Great style, but way smaller than had we bought in a store. A 36 fits like a 32."

					"\n\nThis is a very comfortable pair of khakis that I wear for both work and going out. I'm about 175 cm and 66 kg, and this sizing fits great. I've had this pair for several months and it washes well in the washing machine without noticeable lost in it's shape. I've never had the need to iron the pants as long as I hang it immediately after washing. However, without ironing, the crease line does become less prominent with time, as would be expected. Some stitiching have come loose at the pockets in this pair, but this is not a problem for me. Overall, this pair of pants has held up well. The photos included were taken recently. I've bought a second pair and no stitching has come loose. I'm looking at buying a 3rd pair.",
					"I ordered five of these at once to cycle out older pants. They are 100% cotton, which is a hard feature to find now that elastane has taken over the world. The material is a good weight, not too heavy or too light. They are nice-looking office chinos that actually feel on the slightly loose side of slim (which is good).\n\nThere are a few considerations. There are loose threads everywhere, which is common in mass produced pants. One thing that wasn't obvious from the product description is that the crease is not permanent, so if you want a crease you'll have to iron it in. Here's the really weird part: two of the five pairs had an extreme taper and the other three had a straight leg. All the tags are exactly the same, the lengths and waists are pretty consistent, and they are all made in the same country. That deducted a star from this rating. Otherwise they would be solid four-star pants.",
					"Fits perfectly, slim cut and look.",
					"These pants looked so great! I ordered these for my step 16 yo step son to usher in a wedding. He is the tall dirty blond behind the baby (only picture the photographer got him in 🙄) They washed well and really do resist wrinkles. He felt very sharp and stylish in them and wants to save them for an upcoming school formal. Good quality. I'm ordering a longer length to have on standby for his next growth spurt. He normally wears a 27x30 from aeropostale and I ordered the 28 x 30. They were a true 28×30. They still stayed up and looked nice without a belt.",
					"This is an excellent pair of pants as of day one. The fit is good. They are somewhat baggy but actually pretty much perfect to my taste when sitting down, standing up etc. I'm glad I got the 30 length because they are adequately long and if they were longer they'd be too long. I am 5'11'' 243 pounds and the 40x30 fit perfectly for reference, although the waste is a bit unforgiving, so I will be paying particular attention to the drying process also to keep the pants in a fitting size. Although at first I was skeptical of the fit based on first impressions, thinking they were baggy around the legs, I was mistaken; they fit well. Overall I'd recommend them.",
					"Originally I bought these for my husband at Kohls. He LOVES them and they look great on him. He is about 6ft tall and a thin build and these look great on him - very professional and perfect for work! He loved them, I loved them. We were all happy. Then about 3-4 months into wearing them pretty consistently (about once a week) they started getting huge rips and holes in them around pockets, zipper and crotch. Still he loved them so much he insisted on wearing them. Finally when the back pocket was just about ripped off, I tossed them and ordered these. They were exactly the same ones we had purchased at Kohls. Sadly, they only lasted about 3-4 months and the same thing started happening. So I would say be VERY careful with this purchase!!! These aren't made to last more than a season or two.",
					"un muy buen ajuste, comprare mas de estos, siempre he usado el regular fit, pero me gusto como me amoldo este modelo, aunque no estoy acostumbrado a pantalon ajustado, pero la verdad me sienta mejor, comprare mas colores de este modelo, si es que los hay y tengan un precio adecuado",
					"",

Pour le noir j'ai recu une coupe droite. Je sais pas si tous les noirs sont pareil ou seulement un erreur d'étiquettage à l'usine de fabrication mais l'ai retourné et j'hésite à en commander un autre.",
					"",
					"The fit and cut of this Izod pants have changed since the last time bought them. The recent couple of pairs I bought are skinny fit, not slim (thus not as advertised). Very disappointed. They still fit well in the seat area, so I'll be altering them to be knee-length shorts.",

					"I bought these with a bit of concern about the reviews saying they shrink, but they didn’t for me. I typically wear 36x32 pants and the large-32 pants are perfect. If anything they are a touch big both in the waist and length. I assumed that they would shirk a bit when I first tried them on, but if they did I can’t tell. They are loose fitting and made of a nice lightweight material. I’m only one washing in so maybe they will shrink some in future washes. I used the gentle-permanent press cycle and hung them to dry, hitting them with an iron while still damp to reduce the wrinkles. They are linen so they wrinkle, and take a while to dry. I’d definitely buy them again.",
					"First, I usually wear a 32\" x 30\" pant. That goes for dress pants, jeans, etc.\n\nLikes -\nThe material feels great.\nThe overall quality seems good. Pockets have matching buttons, there's no loose threads, etc.\n\nDislike: Size -\nFinding the right fit is too much of a hassle. I bought six pairs of these pants: four in Medium with 30\" inseam and two in Medium with 32\" inseam.\n\n-- The first pair I got (the Medium 30\" in dark blue second from top of the photo and Medium 30\" in castlerock in the middle) shrunk because I washed them like normal, including hot air in the dryer. My bad.\n\n-- The second pair I bought (Medium 30\" in dark blue at the bottom of the photo pile and Medium 30\" in silver (the light colored pants) I washed in a very gentle cycle with cold water and tumbled dry on the lowest heat setting. The dryer didn't matter because the pants shrunk out of the washer.\n\n-- The latest pair (top Medium 32\" in dark blue and middle Medium 32\" in castlerock) are the most disappointing. The dark blue are an actual size I can wear, so I guess I'm happy about that, but the castlerock pair basically shrunk down to the size of the Medium 30\" pair.\n\nDislike: Ability to Return -\nThe kicker is is that you won't find out how much shrinkage until after laundering them, so you really can't return them.\n\nDislike: Price -\nHowever, I found that the price on a similar set of pants jumped from $34.99 to $41.99 the second time I bought them. How convenient.\n\nOverall, these are probably the worst clothing purchases I've made from this site. Which is a shame, because I bought similar pants from another generic Chinese manufacturer and they're horrible. I could have lived with the initial disappointment if the two Medium 32\" pairs would've come in at the correct size, but that didn't happen.",
					"I bought these pants for an upcoming Caribbean cruise. I was a little apprehensive because some of the reviews brought up issues with them shrinking too much but with proper \"break in\", I didn't have any issues. Being linen, one should expect some shrinkage an the first wash and these pants are no exception. Here's the deal; order them understanding you will need time to wash, hang dry and iron them before you wear them. I normally wear a 36X30 pants so I ordered the XLX32. As soon as they arrived, I washed them in cold water with a cold rinse then hung them from the waistband and let them dry in my closet for a couple of days. They fit almost perfect! The waist is still a little larger than I would like in order to call them actually perfect but with the drawstring, they're close enough. The legs fit is amazing though. I gave them 5 stars vs 4 stars because the waist fit was my gamble and not due to an issue with the quality of the pants and they were exactly what I wanted and exactly what I expected. If you're a lose 36 waist, you may want to consider the L vs the XL. Most definitely though, try to order 2 inches taller in the inseam than what you normally wear. They WILL shrink. DO NOT PUT THESE IN THE DRYER... EVER!!!! Highly recommended for those hot summer days on the beach or by the pool.",
					"High quality light weight trousers, very comfortable. At £39.85 including delivery and fees from the USA and arrived in only 5 days, I highly recommend buying and have already ordered another pair.",
					"Took a while too arrive but very nice item",
					"No review",
					"When I received these pants they were too long and I asked my wife to hem them. She said she would wash them first and it was a good idea because they shrank to the correct length. She washed them in cold water and did not put them in the dryer. I would recommend that you take the leg length a full size longer and for me after washing they fit great.\nI will just mention the material is very thin but I am not worried as linen wears extremely well.",
					"I purchased the largest size and was worried I would end up with these funny baggy pants. What a surprise when my husband tried them on a beautiful fit. The material is gorgeous. Hope they will not be shrinking when I wash them because right now they are just perfect.\n\nAfter the first wash the pants shrunk 3 inches in length. Totally disappointed. if you can go without ever washing them you are ok. I washed them in cold water on a gentle cycle. Horrible."

					"I have always been skeptical when ordering clothes on line.I was looking for a summer weight (linen) casual pair of slacks and came across several marketplace sellers.I decided to go with one pr. from each of the better names (knowing that the manufacturing was outside of U.S). OF the two pair the PERRY ELLIS pant was far superior in fit ,style and material.Linen is a great look for summer casual .These slacks will be worn for my summer touring and casual dining . They are advertised as beach pants but they are much more. I dont think I would throw this on to cover a dried out pair of swim suit. Rather wear them to the bar at poolside or a restaurant by the ocean. This pair is tied in front with a draw string but also has belt loops (which some may prefer) which I would not attempt to use as it takes away from casual look. I went with the natural (straw) color so I could have more if a selection of tops. I am right about that knowing whats in my closet...... My only concern with any linen or cotton clothing is \" what will happen when cleaned (shrinkage). All linen and pure cotton clothing is advisable to hand wash in cool water , hang dry and iron at cool setting. I have not had the opportunity as of this evaluation to clean this garment. But I will follow the directions and hope for the best. Please note that I am on the thin side and feel these slacks are almost a perfect fit for a summer slacks which follow my contour and are not tight but feel very comfortable.\nIf I find that after a cleaning a size change such as shrinkage or thread wear occurs I will add this to my evaluation.I know I will enjoy this pair up to and hopefully after it's first cleaning.",

					"I went back and forth reading reviews and looking at photos of linen pants and really didn’t want to spend $60. The pants arrived and they are well made, the fabric is first rate and the fit is perfect. I am 5’10”, 170 lbs and typically wear a 33 x 32 which is always a bit too long. I ordered the 32x32. The waist is perfect as is the length which I estimate to be 31” actually. They are not baggy in fact they are perfectly cut for what they are...a cool casual summer pant. I ordered the natural linen and the color is very nice. Highly recommend.",

					"Nice material. Lightweight. I think they are slightly pricey but all in all I'm satisfied. My typical waist is 33\" and that's what i ordered. 33\" x 32\". I'm 6' tall, about 175lbs. for reference. I do wish they were a touch longer but with a pair of flip flops for that beach resort look, they work. So if you're looking for something a little more classier than your cargo shorts or jeans for your next vacation, I'd recommend them.",

					"I've never worn linen and it seems shirts and pants (linen) are more popular today. I wore these to work and got a lot of compliments. I'm 5-10 and have a 34 inch waist. It fit as expected and they are a lot more comfortable than dress pants, even jeans. It seems like the button on the top will eventually be used and abused but they provide you an extra button. I'm happy with this purchase.",
					"My husband bought these for a beach wedding in The Dominican Republic. They were extremely comfortable and lightweight in a VERY hot and humid climate. Perfect to wear with a nice shirt and flip flops. Definitely needed to steam these after packing in a suitcase. He bought 34W/32L and they sat right at his heels. Would definitely buy these again.",
					"Excelent quality.",
					"Great!!! I recomand it!",
					"After wearing the first pair I purchased for a few weeks, I bought a second pair and then a third. I studied apparel production and I've been sewing most of my life. It's not easy to make linen look good. It's not a stable fabric. It requires a healthy amount of reinforcing to keep pockets from sagging and waist bands from folding over. This pant has got as much of that kind of support work as I would have thought possible and a lot of meticulous top stitching to keep the waist and pocket details crisp. They are the most incredibly comfortable pants to wear, especially during our recent heat wave. When they're ironed, they're classy enough for The Great Gatsby but hot pressing isn't necessary and too much heat pressing shortens the life of linen. These look great after being hung to dry and just as good pulled out of a dryer. I only there were more colour choices.",
					"A tale of two cities! The first order I received was a 36 x 32...they were so big a belt didn't even help much. Because I made the mistake and thought the pant work I kept them, as I was leaving for Punta Cana the next day. I wish I had returned them, but I liked the fabric and style so much, when I got home I ordered another pair...34 x 32. Figured I could sell the larger pant or give them away. The second pant I received was tight, but loose a few pounds and they would be good. This is where I really got pis-ed off! This order was a pant that had been worn before and were dirty! The tag inside said made in Indonesia and the hanging belt loop tag said made in China and no mention of \"PERRY ELLIS\" So I'm returning the second pant and keeping a \"WAY TOO LARGE \" pant, that I will donate to charity. So I'm out $70.00...don't make my mistake!!!!!!!!!!",
					"I work a desk job and I like pants that breathe. I don't like paying $90 for pants, but considering how difficult it is to find lightweight linen pants, and how I own pants for many years before retiring them, I desecrated my piggy bank and pulled the trigger on Mr. Ellis' Personal Garb. These were purchased last year and the crotch has completely ripped out since then. They are worn maybe once or twice a week. You'd think I was doing sky-to-floor splits during those brief wearings, but no. I go to and from my desk and that was enough to completely blast away the fabric between my thighs. Practically showing off my dangling participles every time I bent over. Since then, I've had the crotch patched with a pair of similar coloured fabric but now the fabric above the knees (top thighs?) is wearing away and ripping. I'm not a hefty boy nor do I possess Hulk-like abilities, so it's the dang pants fault, not mine. For this type of quality and longevity, I'd pay $8.99. But for $90, they better last 10+ years while undergoing minimal physical exertion. OH, and THREE BUTTONS for undoing the fly!? Does the designer of these pants not understand the purpose of the fly in pants for men?? Do they like the thought of torturing the wearer knowing the struggle one must endure to undo the pants in order to relieve oneself? Can there be an option for a fly that doesn't involve masochism!? Ugh. Worst. $90 linen pants. Ever."

					"I used Carhartt's size and fit guide on their website to figure out what size to get. Their size and fit guide recommended the same size I wear in another brand. So I ordered that size. When they arrived, I tried to try them on, but couldn't even comfortably pull them all the way up - they were sooo tight. So I returned them. If you order these pants, order them about 2 sizes larger than what you normally wear.",
					"The pants are a nice material and generally a good fit, although the waist runs about 1\" smaller than usual and even slightly less than stated waist measurement. The only reason I don't give these pants 5 stars is that the knees have blown out on 4 pairs I've worn for daily workwear over the past year. I suppose that comfort means some level of durability is sacrificed, but if you actually use these pants for carpentry and \"work\" and wash them a couple times a week, then you will need to patch the knees to make the pants last more than about 6 months.",
					"Great quality, excellent stitching. Soft but sturdy material. You can't ask for more. Love them, I just wish they added cargo pockets, but even now it's the best work pants I've had. I compered them to Wranglers , and as you can see on the picture, Wranglers of the same size one inch shorter( Wranglers are of very poor quality as well as sizing isn't true) . So I would definitely recommend to buy Carhartt. Very nice pockets as well.",
					"OK, so I'm short and fat. Why don't they make a 28\" inseam on pants? These are very comfortable pants, almost feel like velour. There are lots of pockets and the material is light, not heavy like blue jeans. There is not a lot of seat room and at first I thought they would be low riders, but they are comfortable enough, just not deep like blue jeans. They ride more right on the hips.\n\nFor my waist size the shortest inseam was 30\" and I'm only 5'7\", so I have to roll them up. They're work pants for the garage and yard so I'm not going to have them tailored. Other than the length these are great warm weather work pants.",
					"I",
					"I am 6'-1\", 195lbs. I usually wear 36x32 pants. After reading the reviews, I ordered 38x32. I tried them on and they fit correctly around the waist (thanks reviewers) but the leg was way too long. Also, the leg was too baggy. These are more like loose fitting jeans, not relaxed. While I was trying these on, it reminded me a bit of MC Hammer. Too legit to quit. Also the pants were not a dark black, but looked faded. I am not sure they would be acceptable in a semi-formal office environment. Anyway, I am sending them back. Luckily returns are free.",
					"I'm giving this a 4/5 because most folks order the size they know fits. However as others have pointed out you want to order these on the larger size. I wear a 38/32 any day of the week. I ordered 40/32 but found they were slightly on the smaller size. Sure 40 fit but it fit me like a pair of 36 might fit (I wear 38 because I like it slightly loose). I knew to order larger but had to return the 40/32 and i'm getting a 42/30 now. Yes going to a 30 length because the length was longer then 32... it felt more like 34. Now they could make these longer because a lot of guys wear work boots with these, but I'm not. So a guy who normally wears/38/32 has to order 42/30. I believe that might fit... Otherwise it was a comfortable pair opf pants and I'm VERY picky with what I wear. The pockets could be deeper in my opinion. If a guys wearing Carhartt's he's going to want a nice deep pocket for his wallet.",
					"I own several different styles of Carhartt pants and they all have one thing in common, they need to be sized up one size from what you normally wear in other brands. At least they are consistently off.\n\nOne item that is inconsistent is the cell phone pocket size. I purchased five Carhartt Men's Relaxed-Fit Washed Twill Dungaree Pants and of the five, only three of the cell phone pockets will accommodate my Motorola phone outfitted with an Otter Box cover. The other two pair of pants would not fit the phone for fear of ripping the seams.\n\nThese are great looking pants, comfortable and seem to wear well. Had the cell phone pockets all fit my phone, I would have rated these five stars.",
					"Perfect fit - Relaxed Fit for Carhartt is what I would call Straight Fit here in the UK - size and length as described - triple stitch on the side for added strength - can't fault the price either, £30, bargain",
					"Slight issue with the description as I thought that they were the same fabric as others I have purchased. However these are the smooth lighter fabric. Same quality though so at the price I decided to keep them.\nThe lengths are very generous and 34\" is more like 35\" inside leg so you may get away with a smaller size than you think.\nDesign could do with a button pocket for a wallet as the back pocket is pretty loose.",

					"Feel great, lets the breeze through and easy to move in. These make you wonder sometimes if you forgot to wear pants today. I cannot find the words to describe how much nicer these are than some other \"golf pants\" I own. May wear those for yard work or something, but my goto pants for a round are now my Izods!",
					"Very, very comfortable and they look great too!\nNice attention to detail with the elastic band at the bottom opening of the front pockets, and the logo shirt grippers in the waistband. Only problem was that I ordered one gray and one black. For some strange reason the black was a full inch longer even though both were supposed to be the same size. Just hemmed it up. I love 'em!!!",
					"Purchased size 33x34 for my 6'2\" tall 185 pound son. I was worried they would be too long but the length is perfect. He needed lightweight pants for a uniform and these fit the bill nicely. They've been washed a couple times and hung to dry and seem to hold up well.",
					"Fantastic fit all over for these pants. I am a bigger golfer 6-00/240lbs. These pants give plenty of room where needed in the waist, seat, and thigh area. Elastic stretch material is where it needs to be. I normally wear a 38x30 and chose a 42x30 just to be safe due to thinking these would be based of a slimmer build. Glad I did. Absolute perfect fit.",
					"Love this one. Perfect fit for men. Wrinkle free. What I love is wear for golf & go for dinner . I don’t have to change anymore.\nPrompt, first size was order accidentally wroung by me & was promptly replaced without hassle.",
					"I bought these in black. Very light and comfortable. Not heavy enough to keep you warm on a cold day, but nice enough to eliminate a chill on the cool mornings. True to size. I wear 36x32 in jeans and 38x32 in dress slacks. I purchased the 36Wx32L and they fit perfect. Straight Fit has plenty of room, not baggy or relaxed. Will buy more colors when available.",
					"These are great looking pants that wear and wash well! My husband has a tough time getting pants to fit right and these have a nice waistband with stretch and slip guard...he usually gets a 38 but I went with a 36 and they are perfect!",
					"Lovely soft light material. Perfect for summer holfing",
					"Damn! This pants are amazing!!! I was sceptical due to low price, then thought the top reviews were probably too generous, but there not! I was very pleasantly surprised, perfect loose fit, very thin so you can wear them even on hot days. Just wow! I don't play golf more then once a week so I'm probably good with just one pair, but I'm going to buy another one just because it's such a good deal. Don't think, don't wait, don't hesitate just buy them now!",
					"What I like most about this product is that they are exactly as described - and work exactly as described. My husband was golfing with our son and a couple of other friends on an extremely hot day. Although the other 3 wore shorts, my husband was actually the most comfortable as the pants wicked away any moisture. Excellent product: bought another pair!",
					"So I'm one of those weird golfers who only wears pants...and I typically by the puma 5 pocket jackpots which I love, but they are not cheap and couldn't find a pair in khaki that fit me...these Izods were perfect, super comfy, good fit and look great especially for the price. Just wish they had more colours.",
					"Very light weight. Used them in restaurants as work pants since the kitchen was hot they keep cool and not make you fell like your over heating. The elastic waist band makes for a relaxed concert and they don't wrinkle easily and are slightly water resistant."

					"With COVID-19, our company has gone to casual clothing so there's no need to wear my dress shirts, tie and wool slacks. I wanted something a little more dressy than Dockers (and their ilk) so I ordered the Haggar slacks in four colors, black, blue, grey and darker blue/grey. They fit perfectly ... it's hard to find slacks for us aging seniors that are shrinking vertically but expanding horizontally :p ... I used to be a 30x32 when I was 25, now I'm a 32-34x29 at 67. Such is life .... I'm glad to see that you can order slacks with shorter inseams; no hemming required. These slacks are \"the deal\", I could buy four pairs for the cost of one pair of my wool slacks. No sense wearing $200-$300 slacks with a \"polo\" shirt.",
					"I love these pants, they look great,\nsuper comfortable and very affordable. They are machine washable and come out of the dryer ready to wear. My only complaint is that out of the 5 or so pairs I've bought 3 have hab the hem on the leg come undone. I thought it was a fluke after the first one but when it happened to 2 more pairs it seens obvious that its a design flaw. It only cost me $12 each to fix so it hasn't stopped me from wearing them or even buying more pairs.",
					"Love Haggars. Wear my others to work almost every day. I have the other ones on here that have an expandable waist so the size doesn’t have to be perfect. These are less expandable but the slim fit looks better. I’m not slim, but it tapers in at the ankle which, in my opinion, looks more professional than the other ones which are a little baggy but still good. Hard to find perfect waist size without having nice suit pants tailored. But I actually like these better than wool suit pants because I can throw them into the wash and they come out pretty much without any wrinkles. Makes it easy to look professional every day. Just ordered my 3rd pair for color variety in my life.",
					"I like these dress pants. They're very lightweight, comfortable and look great in a business casual and/or business professional position. They're about a half inch too long and there were a few strings that needed to be clipped off but I imagine that's from bulk production and low quality control. But the length is still possible and the pants arrived in otherwise great condition. It would be nice to have a jacket paired with these pants instead of buying it separately so as to keep the colors consistent. I recommend these dress pants. So far, so good.",
					"My son wears pant size 38x30\nNow\nUsually while shopping for slacks or any kind of dress clothes I always buy a size or two bigger as I know they tend to run smaller …\nBut putting my shopping experiences to the side\nI went with my hypothetical thoughts that I had\nWhich were\n“These pants say they are expandable\nSo they should fit to size”\nOoohhh I was sooo very wrong…\nI suggest buying 2 sizes up\nBut\nMy suggestion are being made on a 250lb 5’7 boy\nIn our case\nThe thighs were tight\nThe waist wasn’t nearly close to buckling!!\nBut\nThe length was perfect\nThe material was magnificent!!\nThe color of black on point\nBeautifully , beautifully made!\n\nSo I rate with a one mostly because I feel\nIf you’re going to advertise that something is comfortably fit/stretched , then they should fit to size\nThe quality of the slacks tho\nDefinitely deserve a 4/5 *",
					"I was a little skeptical when I purchased these, because the price was so reasonable. I am very impressed with the look and feel of these slacks. They look and feel like much more expensive slacks. I especially like the silicone around the inside of the waistband, that creates friction between the pants and shirts that are tucked in. I have found, my shirts stay tucked much better. AND these are seriously comfortable slacks. I am short, and I have larger thighs and calves, and the slim fit is snug, but not too tight. I wish there were more color choices. I would buy them all!",
					"I bought these slim fit trousers for my husband for Christmas and he LOVED them. So I ordered 2 more so he can have 3 colors: Black, Grey, and navy. He is tall and thin, and these look very classy on him - the regular fit are too sloppy and baggy on him, but these are very attractive. Highly recommend.",
					"I'm 6'4\", 195, and these 36x32 pants fit perfectly--in fact, they fit even better than a pair of pants I bought recently that I had tailored. The break is just right, and the measurements throughout are spot-on. The pants are really comfortable, too. Great deal!",

					"Bought this for my son and he is happy. He said it's so comfortable and feels so nice to wear. On top of it all, I only paid $11.95 because it was on sale. Great quality for a great price. Happy customer here.",
					"My only negative, and I have bought several pairs, the hem comes off on all of them, so needs a better stitch by your ankles, relative good overall though. Fits ok, comfortable, looks good.",
					"When I purchase pants in stores, they come in either 32 or 34 waist size. Size 33 was available here. So I get perfect fit for a third of the price I would pay in a store, deliverd at my door. Very comfortable, stretchy and relatively thin, perfect for summer. Bought a second pair right away.",

					"Love these pants. I’m 5’8 178lbs with a 33 inch waist. Size 32 fit me perfectly. I’d say the leg was about a 31. Waist stretches just enough to hold them up if I don’t load up my pockets and jog. I wish the draw strings were shorter and soft and loose, but they are long and stiff and can be put in a position sort of like hair sprayed hair. I might cut them. Also white is (obviously) see through. H&M sells nice white trunks for about $1.25 a piece. Get some.\n\n...oh and if you find yourself in public, about to give it a shake after relieving yourself, think twice and shake carefully.",
					"I was unsure how they would fit and I read the reviews carefully and I made the right decision. I’m 6’ 215 and sometimes wear a 38 waist and sometimes a 40 (usually if I want a little extra room for my rear and legs. I went with the 38 because the reviews said that they ran a little big and were roomy. The 38’s give me plenty of room and comfort and they don’t look too large. The 31 inch length is perfect. They are are very comfortable and look fitted too.",
					"This material seems like it will feel nice in summer. I ordered a couple sizes too big tho. A 34 was like 38. Will exchange. The waist is way stretchy. So you might need to order a size down or two.\nAfter size exchange to 32: better fit except the waist band can still stretch a lot. I did notice at the end, it said \"plus size.\" They'll be good for knocking around. Pants had draw string and belt loops. I'd wear my shirt over the pants. Not tucked in. Only odd thing is, I ordered a blue pair at the same time from same place, but they are in a different shipment than this one.",
					"Bought these pants as I am losing weight and am in awkward pant sizes. Some pants were fitting me too baggy and my smaller pants were too uncomfortable. These were perfect, other than the drawstring which don't fit the look for work. I bought some stretchy belts and those made these perfect. These are extremely breathable since I live in a hot state. I mainly use the black pair for work and save the colored ones for the weekend since the colors are a bit too bright for my taste. I always joke the blue ones make me look like I'm wearing scrubs. Buy one pair and try them out! Keep in mind, they shrink slightly after a wash so the fit goes from baggy when new to straight fit which is perfect for me (I have thick legs). After I bought one pair I bought two more so I don't overuse them and tear a hole in between the thighs. Overall, I am really happy with these and plan on buying more. I bought a size smaller than I am now since most reviews were saying they run big. Glad I did! They are extremely stretchy and comfortable.",
					"These pants are awesome. My first investment in light, breathable pants for the heat down in South Florida. These have locket space, a quality zipper fly, and drawstrings to keep the waist. They were maybe a half size to a size bigger than expected, but the drawstrings just make them more comfortable.",
					"I absolutely love these pants. They have a button, zipper and belt loops as well as the drawstring. They are super light to wear. I got them for my trip to Florida as the weather was to be in the 90s. I used them while at the hotel relaxing and I didn’t want to wear shorts. I also used them for my trip home as I was leaving 95 degrees and going home to the mid 40 degree weather. They were perfect for being comfortable in Florida and on the flight. Yet enough to be warm back home when I landed. Definitely going to be my new favorite. Will be ordering another in black as well since white can get dirty so fast.",

					"These dress pants are pretty good. I like the quality and the texture. The brown is not too “loud” or poop-colored (thank God). It’s more of a darker brown but not I wouldn’t consider it “dark brown” however. I needed to add another dress-pants color to my closet and this was a perfect match.\n\nThey do seem to run a bit large. The title says “stretch slim fit” so I usually go with a 36x32 in that case. If pants run big or are straight or relaxed, I go with a 34x32. These pants seem to fit like “straight” so I would order one waist size down than you normally wear and that’ll be closer to slim fit (if that’s what you want). If you want them a tad loose then stick with your normal size.\n\nThe price is maybe $5-10 more than I think they’re worth. Not too bad. Other than that, I like these pants and will consider buying another color as well.",

					"These pants are pretty great, but feel a little tighter than I expected. Maybe I just got quarantine fat. That's probably the more likely case. I'm slowly transitioning to dress clothes that allow some stretch maneuverability...gone are the days of the rigid tight shell we've all dealt with in the past. These stretch with your body - whether it's mild quarantine obesity or bloat from last night's unreasonably salty Pho.",
					"Super nice and comfortable",
					"I ordered this for my wife for our wedding and the quality and fit was perfect! Made slight alterations, she’s a bit short so it had to be hemmed about 2” and 1” on each side to give it a more skinny leg look. She’s 5’4, I highly recommend this pants!",

					"It's really hard to find slacks that have a slimmer cut, modern look that don't turn into skinny pants or are made with really cheap material. These pants are perfect. Really well made. Don't warp when washed. They look super professional and classy and have nice slim lines that are flattering to men who want to look modern and hip without looking unprofessional. And even though they're slim, they aren't tight around the crotch (which has been an issue for my husband in the past even with looser cut pants). We bought the brown and the blue. I hope they keep making this particular cut because it is ideal. We tried sooo many other brands and just returned them because they were too \"old man\" baggy or too cheap and skinny.",

					"It is difficult for a guy with my build to get pants. At 65 years old more active than the majority...I have never been a skinny guy though not obese, but athletic with larger thighs and calves. It is imperative that I have slacks that are stylish but I will never be a \"skinny pants\" guy, so they must have room for me to move comfortably. Even ordering online, these pants/slacks fit the bill. i only wish they had more poly-wool blends to choose from.",

					"More pros than cons, unfortunately.\nPros - The color is ok. That is it.\nCons - The waist is not expandable and fits very tightly. I may have received the incorrect product as ther is no sign of an expandable side waist section.\nThe fabric is very thin, not at all like a casual business fabric.\nI would like to return this but have already removed and discarded the tags.\nVery dissatisfied.",
					"This line of pant is made in several Asian markets (Cambodia and Bangladesh ), and the sizing varies, as does the tailoring of the pant. You must try these on and do not assume that product within the same order are, in fact, the same pant.",
					"I bought these pants 5 months ago, just before a leg injury that prevented me from wearing them until now. All of the labels are still on the pants - I never even unfolded them or tried them on until now. They fit fine, but there is a snag in the fabric on one leg that cannot be repaired, which I didn't not notice until now. It is too late to return them. I have several pair of these same pants in other colors and am very happy with them. This is just a warning to other buyers - examine clothing you purchase online very carefully when it arrives. This was my error for not examining the pants closely when they arrived, but I was unable to stand at the time, and had other things on my mind.",
					"I'm a big guy, 42/44 waist. It's difficult to find a pair of pants that give me room to move around without feeling like I'm going to split my seat if I squat down to tie my shoelaces. Several years ago, the trend seemed to be moving towards \"relaxed\" fit, and it was nice... plenty of room in the seat and thighs, but not so much as to make it look like a clown suit. Now, with all the straight-leg and skinny-fit pants, I was ready to switch to wearing a kilt but I could never figure out what I was supposed to wear underneath.\n\nI digress. These pants fit me great. Not only is the fit great, but I really like the fabric - they are indeed \"cool\" pants. Given my bulk, one would assume that I would be a big fan of adjustable waistbands. To be honest, I really don't care for them... they can be bulky and more often than not I find that they encourage my pants to fall down (even with a belt!). These slacks do have an adjustable waistband, but it's not as bad as other pants that I've owned. In my perfect world, they would make a version of these exact pants with a fixed (?) waistband, but they don't and the positives of these pants far outweigh the not-so-bad-but-still-adjustable waistband.\n\nI've had one pair of these pants for several months and it has held up well in the wash and so far hasn't needed ironing. I would say that these pants very appropriate for a business-casual work environment (w/ shirt & tie, or button down, or polo shirt). I don't know if I'd wear them out to the bar on a Friday night the same way I would a pair of 100% cotton khakis, but that's just me.\n\nAnyway, if you're on the stout side and you're looking for some versatile, comfortable, and affordable pants, I suggest you consider Haggar Cool 18.",
					"Bought for husband to wear to a friend's wedding. The button was too tight in the buttonhole, but it appeared the buttonhole had not been properly cut and was easily remedied without causing a problem. They were slightly too snug at waist (although they were same size as his other pants), but the button was able to be moved over a bit without causing a problem with the alignmnet with the zipper. Small things, easily remedied ... but might be mindful of when ordering.",
					"Good trousers. Should buy a size smaller. The tighs are too large for me on size 42 when size 40 in the UK at department stores is too small on the waist.\n\nI am sorry that I thought I had returned this item and that you did not refund me. Actually, my wife never posted the package. My bad :|\n\nIn fact, the product seems very good, only it is too large. My intention was to return it and by a smaller size. I am ashamed that I though wrong of this supplier.\nThis pair of trousers is made with a literally cool fabric, that breathes and does not accumulate heat. Furthermore, the waist has a clever system to stretch if necessary without compromising the cut. Thus you can (and should) buy a size smaller and still benefit from a good fit.\nI recommend it and my sincere apologies for thinking wrong of Haggar. If the size had been right I would have given you 5 star.",

					"Granted i Am A Picky Customer, An a Tough Reviewer As i demand perfection!.\nTo be certain noting built nor constructed by Human Hands is Perfect O.K.\nThe GOOD:\nHaggar Pants arent a perfect but at say 99% they are pretty darn close.\nAs They fit good.\nThey look nice.\nAnd they are very comfortable and they definitely meet the need.\nThey are truly say a 1000 grade heads and grades above all the cheap Bargain Superstore pants etc.\nThey are so good that in truth i have just one gripe which is?????>\nThe BAD:\nExpressed bluntly in a totally ruined and wrecked economy like that which most of us now live in:\nThey Are Too Darn Expensive!.....\nPut simply the pants are superb but expressed frankly a 30 Buck pair of pants is expensive even for a successful writer an Editor like me so how the laid off guys, soccer moms and the Poor people will ever afford these I'll never know???.\nExpressed plainly these pants are 'An Investment' as yes they are pricey but its still a better deal then the 'WonderMart' slacks that the zipper tears out after say a month, Or say the Cuff begins to - Fray - after about 6 weeks so if you value use or longevity then really these pants are a rather great deal and to finish with a positive I like the fact that are are:\\'Availible in nearly all colors of the rainbow which i think is - NEAT - and in truth i really like mine.\nSo Buy And Enjoy!.\nNuff Said:\nIndiana ED",
					"I'm 6' 1\" and have been wearing 32 length in dress pants for 20 years. I own a few pair of Haggar dress pants and they fit fine. I ordered a pair of 36/32 and the length was more like 36\"! So I returned/exchanged for 36/31 thinking it would be more correct...and the return took forever. When I got the new pair the 31 length was still way too long. I've never worn a 31\" length pant in my life and these are more like 34\" long. Not worth the trouble going back and forth exchanging for the correct length.",

A good buy!",
					"This is a very nice dressy trouser with front pleats and the comfort of an expandable waistband. I have purchased these in several colors and wear them every day to work. They remain very comfortable throughout a long work day.",
					"I find it increasingly hard to find a good pair of slacks that fit properly at outlet stores these days. Shopping for pants online can be a bit unnerving because you worry they won't fit right. These fit exactly as I had hoped. They didn't cost me an arm and a leg either. I feel that is also important. Nobody likes to overpay for clothes. I liked that the price was good for a popular brand product. Keep it up!",
					"UPDATE: Replacing a couple year old pair of pants. The new model is cut smaller and has a much shorter crotch length from the waist to the crotch seam. I’m returning my normal size for the next larger one. Hopefully they have a little more room.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I gave up trying to find lightweight Docker pro-pants and tried Haggar on a whim. Very nice slacks. I’m not usually a fan of the old man adjustable waist, but these are comfortable and not bulky. The pants are a little longer than normal, but that provides a nice break just at the ankle.",
					"Pants are great. I gave 4 stars only because they are cuffed. I did not think you could buy them cuffed anymore. The image shows them cuffed but I missed seeing that. They also came tightly bundled which required washing to get the wrinkles out before I could wear them. Not a problem. They came out of the dryer wrinkle free. I was disappointed in that the color I wanted was $10 more.",

					"Fabric is soft. Color is good and hasn’t started to fade yet after several washes. Just the right amount of stretch. Very comfortable and holds my shirts in place pretty well! I want to love these pants, but I have some issues and concerns.\n\nNon-issue:\nThe hidden zipper pocket makes the fabric thicker in that location. I don’t use it and it’s pointless, but it doesn’t typically get in the way so long as it’s zipped up.\n\nIssues:\nThey shrink, and quite a bit, and continue to shrink.\nI ordered a 34” inseam. My inseam measurements following a washer/dryer run are as follows:\n34.25” no wash\n32.50” one wash\n32.25” two/three washes\n32.00” four washes\n31.75” five washes\n\nAt the current rate, another five washes and I’ll have a pair of capris!\n\nAlso, after shrinking a couple inches, ironing has become more challenging. The inseam stitch folds the wrong way about halfway down the leg. This is an annoyance because the fabric will not lay flat and promotes creasing.\n\nI have no conclusion. If they stopped shrinking right now, I’d say order your normal waist size, but get a couple inches longer than you think. Problem is, I think it will continue to shrink. If it does, I’ll come back and update this review.",
					"I don't understand this trend. I've tried two different brands of Chino's and they are way too tight in the crotch. I feel like the Red Sea down there! Very uncomfortable! Give us our room back people! They're also too low on the waist. I would constantly be trying to pull them up, thus making my nautical problem worse!",
					"My new favorite chinos. Very very comfortable. They are designed to ride on your hips not 4 inches higher like so many others. Classic dockers material and styling - on the casual side. I use the zippered security pocket for my cellphone to keep my keys from scratching the screen, perfect placement. Phone doesn’t bounce when you walk like they do in a cargo pocket in fact you don’t even notice it is there it also sis a few inches higher than the deep side pockets so the screen won’t get damaged by the contents. The material is very nice but I would prefer a little more stretch. Pockets would be perfect in my opinion IF the rear pockets had zippers. Still close enough to perfect for me to go back and buy more.",
					"I bought a pair of the blue chinos for my son and they fit well and look nice. They're a step up from jeans but not dress pants so they can be worn for both casual and slightly more formal occasions. The only thing he said was that the length was shorter by about a half of an inch than his other pants with a 32\" inseam. He can still wear them but would prefer that they were a tad longer as they should be. They did shrink a little as well even on low heat. If he buys these pants again, he will buy a 34\" inseam to be sure they are long enough after washing and drying.",
					"I was looking forward to these Docker pants. The comfort waist pants are popular and I've tried a few. The waist on these pants fit fine. They were not baggy through the seat and thighs. What I was the most happy to see is someone finally made a pair of pants for us bigger guys, that have a true tapered leg. Usually the cuff is somewhere around 10 - 11 inches. These have a nice narrow cuff. Somewhere around 8-9 inches. It is the fit through the crotch / rise that does not fit. Crotch is too tight and rise is a bit too short. I returned them. I am curious to hear what others think.",
					"I like the Docker's brand and I like the Roan color, it goes with my fall clothes scheme. First, i am a woman who buys men's pants because of the ability to buy by waist, inseam. It is so much better than guessing at what different women's brand sizing is. The deep pockets are just nicer too. Anyway, first bought 34/34 and thought they were too tight, not much but knew they would shrink in the wash. Returned and bought 36/34 and they fit great. Several hours later I'm cinching them in with my belt, and by the end of the day they were baggy and sagging all over. Washed in hot water and dried on high heat to shrink them and they felt good again. But again they stretched out all over. Have re-ordered in 34/34 in anticipation of them stretching a bit because I really like the color. Seem well constructed with a \"fob\" pocket along the seam of a regular pocket. Nice feeling fabric, hope they aren't so baggy!",
					"These were supposed to be straight fit but instead we received tapered fit. My husband is 6’8” and 40x38, and boy it’s hard to find tall pants. These are almost tight around the ankles unless we roll it up once, that’s not happening, so I’m hoping they just messed up and sent us the wrong ones? But other then that fit is good around waist and length, he can’t wear his western boots with them and barely Sperrys. Now if he wasn’t in his late 50’s the tapered leg might work and I’m not saying it would be horrible for him to dress like our 18 yr old son but....it does eliminate the reason we bought them, which is for the office.",
					"These trousers are wretchedly poor. The worst pants I have ever purchased. I am returning both pair.\n\nI ordered 34\" waist, 34\" inseam. While marked 34\"/34\", both pair are in excess of thirty-seven inches in waist measurement and inseam, plus the truly execrable degree of stretch. Two percent \"elastane?!\" I can only conclude that \"elastane\" is another name for latex from a Trojan factory. And that the percentage is nearer fifty%.\n\nThese pants will not stay on my hips. A belt requires hideous gathering. I had to roll up the legs twice to keep them from ending under my heels. I want cotton in summer for breathability and comfort. The stretch component of these pants prevent them from breathing and they stick to my backside and legs with the least perspiration, requiring more-or-less constant tugging to pull them away trim the skin and have them drape. And they do not breath. According to my girlfriend, they seem to be intended for someone who pines for the sensation of worn-out panty hose.\n\nThese pants are utter crap. Worst garments I have ever bought. Since your customer service informs me you make no non-stretch pants, I am returning these useless bags and am ending my years-long purchasing history with your company.",

					"These are nice pants, they fit well and I like the stretch. However if you are used to using a back pocket to hold your wallet and don't like using a button to secure the top once your wallet is in place these pants are not for you. The back pocket is shallow and to wide. If you have a normal sized wallet and you attempt to store it in the back pocket you will be losing it all the time, not to mention a pickpocket will never have an easier time stealing it out. Because of the gusseting of the back pocket it actually flares out towards the top vs the bottom of the pocket. I still wear my pair but never use the back pockets.",

					"I really like these pants. The fit and look great. I would highly recommend.",
					"I can't stress enough how much time I spent looking for a true go-to favorite brand and cut of pants. I've finally found the perfect pants for daily wear! Most cargo pants are either too loose, too stiff, have absurdly wide bottoms, or have overly puffy pockets. These have a slimmer profile but are still relaxed enough to be very casual and comfortable. The material has some stretch and give and is pretty soft (the black is a little stiffer than the two greys, which are my favorites). I work in a warehouse environment with lots of bending and stooping and these cargos have been great daily pants that hold up well. I bought 35x32 and initially needed a belt until I washed them, so they do shrink a little. I'm glad I bought 1\" up in the waist from my usual. This accounted for washing and keeps the right balance between the slimmer fit and still having enough room in the thigh. I liked these enough that I immediately bought three more pairs.",
					"Pants look good, and fit ok. Although a little slim.\nProblem is - they are made of stretchy material. So if you put anything in side pocket, it will sag to your knee level. I cant use it for work because of that, and I do not need cargo pants for any other reason.. So if you just need it for looks, then you can buy it, but if you need it for work or for hiking and you want to put something in the pockets - I would not recommend it.",
					"I ordered a pair of these trousers and they were sent from Germany, via Belgium, then customs at Rochester, and they arrived at Cambridgeshire in 6 days. Brilliant. Taking heed of what other reviewers have posted I ordered a waist size 2 inches smaller than I would have ordered had I not read this on their reviews. I would have normally ordered a 42\" waist but I actually ordered 40\" with 30\" inside leg. Result - a perfect fit and very comfortable. They are elasticated and I will need to wear a belt as I would usually but this is what I expected anyway. Excellent fit, not at all baggy, and excellent value. In fact, I have since ordered, and received, the same size in dark grey and I am very pleased with them, too.",
					"I normally buy my husband 32w/32l trousers from the supermarket (he's not too fussy!) but he doesn't like the modern tapered leg so I had to hunt around for alternatives and found these. He likes them but they are too wide around the waist and crotch area and tightening his belt makes them look awful with unintended pleats. We'll try again with a smaller size as they are exactly what he's looking for at a price I like. In fact we ended up going 2 sizes down (from 32\" to 30\" waist) as even the 31\" waist was too baggy. They seem well made and the grey is a good colour.",
					"The beauty about these cargo pants in not just the range of colours and the style but the fact that, whatever shape and size you are and no matter how far it is from your waist to your ankles, there's a size to fit you.\nI bought my wife that new sewing machine for nothing ... she no longer needs to do any alterations ... out of the bag, in with the legs and walk away.\nWith the waist being flexible you can go down a size ... I've done both (my normal size and down a size) and both worked fine. This gives added flexibility when ordering as, if your chosen colour is not available in your normal waist size, then you still have another bite of the cherry.",
					"These are a good quality trouser, in nice stretch cotton, they come up large, i,e a 36 will fit a 38 waist, the leg length is spot on though, leg width is just right and look great with trainers, sandals or desert boots. Leg pockets are great for phone and wallet and front pockets are deep and made out of good quality material. They are quite low rise at the front and fit well at the rear without being baggy. For the money i am very happy with these.",
