          "Â Exactly what I wanted, a white tee that I could wear without the undershirt feel.",
          "bad! bad! bad! Very bad quality under-shirts with extremely thin material. All shirts came with defects and loose threads everywhere. Never again any product from Gildan!",
          "Few items to note here. First the cost of these shirts are super cheap so I expected them to not be the greatest quality or to last a super long time either. Figured I would buy these for an upcoming vacation and if they lasted after that, it would be a bonus. Two of the four shirts were not even stitched at the sleeve and one had some threads that if pulled would pull apart the collar stitches. There is a difference being of cheaper quality and not even assembling your product properly to sell. With only one good shirt in the bunch, the deal for 15.00 for four shirts really is 15 for one wearable shirt. Beware as you will get what you pay for here.",
          "This set of shirts was pretty affordable and had different colors, making it a must buy for me since I wanted to replace a good portion of my undershirts. Arrived today and I put one one. Fit nice, material was nice, but straight out of the package, one shirt has a very noticeable hole in the shoulder seam. Not entirely sure what happened but I hope the seller contacts me and resolves this.",
          "So the price was right. Hard to complain when it's $2 a shirt. As it turns out, that's about what they're worth. First thing I noticed was that they're short and wide. They're not tapered as suggested in the description and pictures. It's a one-size-fits-all design. That can really be seen in the neck opening. For the Large size that I got, it's a whopping 11.5 inches in diameter. That means for normal men, it will sit low, causing a lot of neck and back to be exposed, and also, the neckline will be really loose. For comparison, my Jockey t-shirts are 8.5 to 10 inches, and a couple that I got at Target (Merona) are 9 inches. To make matters worse, after one wash, the material along the neckline curled badly. An oversized neck opening with a curled rim is NOT a good look. The shirts are simply unwearable in public. So all 6 immediately go into the rag drawer and I'll use them for painting or other messy jobs where it's okay if the shirt gets ruined. No idea why these shirts are getting good reviews.",
          "I'm used to Hanes shirts, and these are very comparable in quality and fit. The large fits my 6'1\" frame correctly.\n\nMy minor complaint is that the arm holes and girth around the belly is ever so slightly larger than the Hanes, which are also too large. My arms are not small, and there is so much material in the arms that they flare out and minimize the appearance of my physique. The length could be just a tad longer too (perhaps half an inch). I realize these are undershirts and wear them as such, but I would prefer that they were more form-fitting. I realize they are necessarily made larger to accommodate heavier guys (I'm 190lbs), but they just aren't quite what I was hoping to get.\n\nFor the price, these are a fantastic buy.",
          "You are looking at these because you want some white t-shirts but want the cheapest set you can find. These shirts are \"good enough\" for an undershirtz provided that you don't care if they shrink after one wash. If you just wear them under your work shirt and take them off when you get home, these are perfect. If you want to wear these as a shirt by itself, I'm not so sure this is the best option. Maybe I just shouldn't have put this in the dryer but then again other shirts I've done this with haven't shrunk so much.",
          "\"Men's Crew T-Shirt\" with 6\" of blouse hanging like a fool, and an absurd toilet bowl seat of a collar -- purposely disguised (downplayed) in the product photos. These might be okay--if you're cool as a ghost pepper n need to shove a pound of cotton in your trousers for that oh so glorious drill sergeant tuck, or you're going to a Halloween party as 1999 Slim Shady--as an undershirt, but unless you're 6'5\"+ or very overweight (to compensate for all that material down yonder) yet somehow still have a 42\"-44\" chest, then you're going to look completely ridiculous in this clown shirt.\n\nConsidering the price point, this is precisely the QC I should've expected from this sorry product -- 'proudly' shelved alongside MainStays goods at WallyWorld. Geez Gildan: I'm done with your company. These are being sent back.\n\nWhy should anyone buy these? I guess if you're the type of guy who takes your girl to Arby's for the holidays, then these would make for perfect pajamas to go on your loved one and along with your frugal affairs -- especially when she needs to blast Taco Bell out at 4am the morning after her BDay and there's no time to drop trou.\n\nTL;DR Clown shirt w/ toilet seat for collar.",
          "I bought these shirts because the graphic tees I've worn since the 9th grade (I'm 25) no longer cut it. I'm supposed to be an adult (we all know this is Fake News), and can't be wearing a shirt that says \"Vote for Pedro\" on it to a business meeting. Who am I kidding, though. I haven't ever attended a business meeting - thanks for ruining the economy, mom and dad! Needless to say, I'm the freshest looking guy in my Social Justice class now. This was the perfect amount of shirts, now that I don't have to choose which shirt I want to wear in the mornings I can spend more time thinking about where I'm going to buy my Avocado Toast.",
          "I really like the length of the shirt. Long enough to cover my belly. I'm 5'7\" 170lb and whenever I buy size medium the shirts are a tad short. But these ones have a perfect length.",
          "I am typically a medium, and the reviews said they tend to fit small so I ordered large. They are a bit too big for my liking, but not so much. So if you're a medium or slightly larger, buy large... If you're on the smaller side of medium, buy medium.",
          "I ordered these to wear while I workout and do lawn work. The Dry Fit (polyester) irritates my skin. These claim to have moisture wicking technology, but I've never heard of cool spire. The only cotton wicking technology I've heard of is wicking windows and transdry (charged cotton). I have no idea which one Cool Spire is based off of. 6 shirts for the price of $22 is good. None of the shirts have a defects with the stitching like others have claimed, and the sizing is right. I like the length of the shirts, they are not too long that they almost go down to your knees, but they are long enough that if you raise you arms, they still cover your mid section. The quality of the cotton is fine, it isn't the softest, but I've had far worse. I'll say it is average to slightly above average. I've purchased white undershirts from Gildan in the past, they are the same quality as their regular shirts, but not as soft as their premium shirts. The only negative I would say is that they don't look exactly like the pictures. In the pictures the body portion looks more fitted, in reality the body portion is simply straight down, but I was expecting that based off other reviews.\n\nPros\nGood quality for the price\nI found the fit to be accurate to the sizing chart\nlength of shirt is good\nNone of the shirts had any defects that others have claimed.\n\nCons\nSoftness of cotton is average to at best slightly above average.\nShirts are not as depicted in the photos. The body is of shirt is not fitted, but straight down.\n\nNeutral\nI have no clue what technology Cool Spire is based off of or if it uses both.",
          "I purchased these t shirts I my hi and toner to work. He outside all day and white is better in the summer (works construction). So the feel of them is great, not too thick, not too thin. Theyâre a great fit in him. Heâs 6â2. But the most annoying thing is that some of the shirts have the label printed on the front of the collar. Like itâs been stamped??? See the picture. These ones are an embarrassment to wear obviously... so out of 6 shirts, we use 4. Maybe too much mass production..."

          "I am 6'0\" and about 205-210 pounds. My chest and shoulders are a little bigger from working out in the past than compared to an average build.\n\nI was hesitant buying this because I couldn't settle on a size. I am in the awkward zone where my size sits in between a Large and an XL size and it entirely depends on the brand of shirt to get a good fit. I ended up buying the Large shirt instead of the XL and it fits great. The material is light and breathable and working out is great with these! The designs and colors are cool, but I mostly bought these shirts for the material. Upon opening, the shirts do have a weird smell but if you air them out a bit it goes away. I don't notice any smell anymore.",
          "The shirts came as expected, no major complaints. I'm just under 5'11\" and about 180-185. I originally bought size Large, but these shirts are long in length and didn't fit my body as expected. Normally I buy Large sizes, but with these shirts, I went back for the Medium to get a more snug fit. I'm satisfied currently and they have held up over a few months of wearing 5 times a week. So far I would recommend them.",
          "The shirts are of a clinging material, so no matter what size, they will cling to your body. It doesn't matter to me because I'm losing weight. They are well made and rather thin, so they will be great summer shirts. This is the second set of shirts I've bought, and they are all excellent.",

          "Iâm 5â9 200+ lbs. with very large muscles. I ordered the xl and I loved it. The material is seriously the best. Iâve never wore a shirt that felt better on my skin. It fit my body perfectly. Unfortunately it was too long. I like to wear my shirts untucked and the bottom hung down past my butt. I sent it back and ordered the large. I hoped the fit would stay the same but the length would be cut down. Half was true. It was now the right length but the chest and arms are too tight. So aggravating. If youâre a lean guy then this shirt will fit you perfectly. If youâre taller this shirt should fit you well too. If youâre 5â9 and super stocky itâs going to be too long or too tight. Take youâre pick. Hope this helps somebody. If anybody finds a shirt like this that fits a little more loose or not so long please let me know.",

Iâm a tall guy and was worried that less expensive shirts would be geared for regular (i.e. shorter) guys. Turned out that these shirts are, frankly, perfect. Iâve actually order another set.

          "OK, if you are like me and are trying to find those awesome Champion t-shirts that you have had for years, this is definitely NOT that shirt. I think I got mine, years ago, at Sam's Club so I came on here to get more. The old shirts were made of nice, thick cotton with a great fitting neck and a strong collar. The collar on this shirt is non-existent (See Pics). The I am 6'2\" and 270lbs (I like to think all muscle but I am kidding myself) and the old shirts fit perfectly. I do have some in the 2XLT and I like those even better. Either way, they were just great shirts and I wanted more. I mean, for an $8 shirt is is just \"OK\" and doesn't fit anything like the old shirts. It isn't as long.. I wouldn't have bought it had I seen it in person but I will keep it. It is that new stretchy and polyester feeling \"Cotton\" that I am not a fan of. Maybe, I was just disappointed that this shirt was not like the ones I hoped to replace. I did however, order multiple brands with this order so I will review them, too.",
          "If you're bigger and taller than most, buying a t-shirt can be challenging. Even if the shoulders or waist are wide enough, the length is often short. This Champion tee is BOTH big enough and long enough to please you. The fabric is soft and of medium thickness. It's also somewhat stretchy for good fit and easy movement. The color is good, but not awesome. I'd give the charcoal heather a 7 out of 10 because it lacks a bit of richness and visual texture. But for a staple piece, it looks polished enough. And the price... On sale, they're a fantastic value.",
          "Exactly as expected. If you want a basic menâs or âuniversityâ T-shirt this is perfect. Itâs soft like youâd expect a Hanes basic T-shirt to be and has the structure that you want for an oversized T-shirt.\n\nSIZING:\nRuns true to size and long. Iâm 5â9â, busty, usually wear a L. For the very oversized look the XXL was perfect once washed.\n\nIt does shrink a full size when you wash and dry it the first time. I ordered one in an XXL based off reviews (I normally wear a L and wanted this to be cover my bum, super oversized). I knew I wanted more colors, but out of the box the XXL was bigger than I wanted so I ordered my next round in an XL hoping those wouldnât be too large. However once washed and run through the drier the XXL is perfect. Once I steam the XLâs to stretch them out a bit theyâre great, but itâs annoying to steam a T-shirt every time you wash it.\n\nI also noticed that the white was much softer and a little thinner than the other shirts.",
          "I own 7 different colors. They are 100% cotton so they do shrink a fair amount. I bought a size up. Theyâre thick enough to age well but not so thick that theyâre hot. I would not use this as an undershirt, for that Iâd get Hanes/Fruit of the Loom. I prefer Champion over those other two for tees because they donât get sun-faded and dingy as quickly.",
          "I",
          "My husband has worn Champion 100% cotton shirts for years for his workout purposes. Some of his shirts were getting pretty old so we ordered this Champion shirt as well as another well-known, classic brand. He has no complaints. He has been dieting and has lost some weight but we opted to still order the XL so it does fit a little loose at this time. When he loses more weight we'll order the next size down and of course order this classic again.",
          "Glad I read the reviews because people were NOT kidding about how much this shrinks. I'm a 5'5\", 120lb woman and usually wear a small or medium in women's and an XS in men's. I bought a medium in this, knowing it would be huge (and it was), and washed it and dried it on low. It came out about 1.5 sizes smaller and now fits between a men's S and XS. This is excellent because I planned for it, but would obviously not be excellent if I didn't. So make sure to size up or else plan to air dry it forever. It's a great, inexpensive tee, as long as the sizing is right.",

          "I passed these up for my BF Oct. birthday based on reviews that seemed more negative, but they seemed so cute, so I ordeI red for Christmas. My BF likes a looser fit ( not clingy around the waist), and the XL fit him perfectly. He is 5' 10\" and about 190, kind of a big boned, square guy, and they do not cling to him. We certainly did not notice any weird smell, like some reviewer said, and I don't know how they would possibly pill, like some other reviewer said. I ordered Cowhide, Frost Grey and Olive, and he loves them all, and I do, too. We like the notch neck with the button detail and the fact that they are distressed looking. A perfect choice for him! The fabric is nice and not too thin.",
          "I",
          "I may be a little nuts, I'm not gonna lie, but I love these shirts and I buy them a lot. There is one thing, and this is probably my fault, but they get a little torn up in the wash. I haven't figured that part out yet lol. Maybe someday someone will teach me how to properly use a washing machine. In any case, I really only wear these shirts and this brand, simply because of the feel and weight of them.",
          "UPDATE:After just 3 washes these shirst are falling apart. I ordered five. They also pill after just one wash - on the inside. Would not buy again.\n\nHad no idea what to expect having never worn this brand. Right out of the package this shirt was the softest I've ever felt. I tried it on (XL) and it fit perfect - not to tight, not to lose. I was a bit worried when I washed it but zero shrinkage. It really does look good fellas. Gonna order a couple more.",
          "Better priced on lucky website but I had a gift card so bought here. Still worth the higher price based on quality though. Very soft material but not too thin or thick. Stays fairly cool in the summer too. Nice choice of colors as well.",
          "kinda thin/flimsy, no need to put them in the dryer as they dry quickly air dry, they don't cling to the waist\nif you have a little belly, have bought 2 of the shirts already and will be buying more...nice assortment of colors also.",
          "I love these shirts. I bought one because I love henleys. The first one was great so I bought another. And another .. and another. I have five now, great shirts for warm weather. Soft, fits great â¦ a great buy.",
          "Lucky Brand shirts are what I purchase often for my husband. They are quality, especially for the price of the garment. Fit is always as expected and I like the flow of this shirt. Doesnât cling, and hubs is comfortable in them. He can wear these for both work and play, and bonus âwhenâ he destroys them...I know what to replace them with again! Highly recommended!",
          "Really pleased with the style and fit. It comes from the states, but was here within a week. I'm on the border between medium and large depending on the brand, I risked a medium and pleased to say this is a perfect fit, not tight, but also not too baggy. The material is very soft and thin, making it great for hot weather. I chose the dark olive which looks exactly like the photos. I'll definitely be ordering more of these!",
          "Love this brand and the feel !",
          "Absolutely love the way this shirt fits me and will be ordering more, however, the quality of the material is thin. This particular shirt got a small hole within a day after getting a little twisted in something",
          "Mmmh... el color real de la playera que llegÃ³, es 10 veces mas deslavada que el color que viene en la foto promocional. Ademas, es muy ligero el material, digamos que para el verano, no para otoÃ±o/invierno. No la devuelvo por la flojera de hacer todo el tramite. Pero definitivamente en tienda, no la hubiera escogido.",

          "The only regret you're gonna have is that you didn't buy more. If I could offer any sizing advice it would be that their chart is extremely true and accurate. I'm 6'2\", athletic but still a tad fluffy. I wear L and XL, depending on the make of the shirt/jacket/hoodie. Happy I stuck to their chart and chose the XL when I would normally always pick a L in T-shirts.\nWhat's great? The length. I can raise my hands above my head and not expose an inch or two of hamburger meat. The build. Stitching is quality and error-free...The Fit. The thickness and comfort is a perfect balance between softness and lightweight durability with a small, yet perfect amount of taper/elasticity to give the shirts a complimenting look on the upper body without draping all around in the wind (even if you don't look like a mannequin).\nOverall-- you deff get what you pay for with IntoThe Am. No negatives whatsoever. Super impressed. Buying more. Any more positives and this company's gonna have to pay me. Stick with the chart and get some quality T's!",
          "I ordered the olive green and black t-shirts. The material is great, the fabric is soft and comfy and it has between a slim and modern fit to it. For context, I ordered size Lrg, I am 5'11 and 204 lbs. I got kind of a dad bod but this shirt is just loose enough on the midsection to hide it pretty well. I would've given this 5 stars but the color is lighter than the pictures. I expected a darker olive green but this was more of a lighter army green. Aside from that these are great shirts.\n\nPs Please don't judge the messiness of my room in the background. I'm a single dad to a 2yr old lol",
          "Ok. So since I was 19 I've worn the same brand of shirt. Black helmet apparel, as I was a firefighter. Stay with me. I hate clothes that everyone wears, and those shirts were the best, and no one wore them. However I gave up that path, and have searched for years for an alternative clothing line. As I am no longer a firefighter. Yet I kept wearing the shirts bc they were perfect. You would never catch me in an \"american fighter\" shirt driving around in my dads diesel truck. Bc they're for tool bags. I like a soft, nice fitting shirt with tighter sleeves to show my arms off, and something you wont see your typical dbag wearing. Finally, I stumble across into the am. I take a shot. Soft, tight in the sleeves, could it be? I wash it, comes out perfect. Doesnt fold awkwardly or wrinkle or shrink up weird. It's perfect. So moral of the story, I bought 7 more. Try them. They're amazing. Thank you into the am.\nIf you wear american fighter.. dont buy these. Dont ruin my new favorite brand you tool! Stay away! These are for men. Not insecure boys who are all exactly the same person. Rant over.",
          "I normally don't write reviews thus quickly (since it has only been a matter of hours that I've worn the shirt), but I haven't found a shirt that fits and feels this well for the price in, ever, really. My go to was always Target, but I've noticed their quality is not what it used to be.\n\nI will update this review when I have worn it longer, but as you can see from the photos, it fits perfectly to one's body, which just enough polyester to give it that stretchable, breathable feel everywhere you would want it (arms, chest, back, and gut). I just hope they hold up just as well as they look and feel now, then I'll be buying more for sure! (Writing this review \"into the AM\" ð¤£",
          "1. These shirts feel amazing. Light and soft enough to feel good without feeling flimsy and cheap.\n\n2. They run true to size, I ordered Medium and I'm 5'9\" @ 190lbs and the LENGTH is possibly the best part. They fit well around the arms and chest, but are long enough to not have me pulling the shirt down anytime my arms go up in any capacity.\n\n3. The logo, while simple, is enough to take the shirt from any old t shirt to something that can be worn anywhere from a semi formal occasion to an average night out with out much effort on our part.\n\nI was looking for shirts to add to my closet and I am beyond glad to have found these. The shipping was really quick and I'm looking forward to adding more to the collection.\n\n*Will update after the first few wears as well as washing and drying*",
          "Final update - customer service will thank you for buying their product and apologize that their product fell apart, but since they can't confirm how their shirts fell apart, they won't help you. I've reduced this to a 1 star, and will continue to save money buying Hanes X-Temp t-shirts since I've had 10 of them for a year and a half, adlnd none of them are having this issue. Save your money.\n\n(Edit - After 2 months of ownership - loose stitching)\n03.02 - I washed this shirt for the third time since owning it and the bottom seam has already let loose. I washed everything with All Free and Clear, on Tap Cold with like garments and dry everything on \"Delicates\". Unsure why this shirt is already falling apart when my Hanes X-Temps are all still fine after 18 months (And what it costs for 5 of them, is what you spend on a single shirt here).\n\nOriginal:\nI'm 6ft, 225lbs dad bod with broads shoulders, an XL fit me perfectly.\nI'll just say I bought one of these shirts while shopping for jeans, just to try it out and I am very happy with it. I'm always looking for a comfortable fabric shirt, that will move with me, but not be so heavy I overheat. I tend to run very warm, so that was important.\n\nThe shirts are SOOO soft, I was stoked taking it out of the package. This fits well, not tight in any areas, but not boxy or stiff like cheap store brands. Even after washing, shirt fits perfectly.\n\nWent hatchet throwing for 2 hours, was VERY comfortable. Shirts moves with me, doesn't feel restrictive and I wasn't overheating. I was so happy with these I bought 3 more. I didn't think I'd want to spend this much on a TShirt, but I'm happy with these and you will be too."

I attached a picture so you can see how it looks on a normal guy 6'0, 200 lbs -- this is a large. It might be good not to dry it on high so it doesn't shrink or fade. It can be tucked in or out.

I purchased my first shirt almost 1 year ago and today I threw it out due to small holes that appeared after the most recent wash. I don't own many clothes and tend to go very minimal with my wardrobe, so I probably wore this 1-2x times a week with a wash after every wear I have to say that this shirt has held up incredibly well, especially at that price. I should also mention that I own pets, both a dog and two cats so those holes may be due to their nails. Regardless, this is a great product that fits well and is very comfortable. The seams have held up with no problems and the color has barely faded. 100% recommend, about to order a couple more myself.",
          "It is indeed soft. Pay attention to all the reviews above regarding size. I normally wear an extra large. That's what I got and it fits well, but it is almost a fitted shirt. It's got good length on the bottom, but if I had to go up a size it would be really long. The real test will be in a couple of months. I bought a shirt from a company that I get Facebook ads for all the time and in two months the collar is rolling and the small amount of synthetic in it is holding odors so badly that I'm going to have to get rid of it. That last won't be a problem here because this one is all cotton.",
          "Amazing shirt. Great quality, great price, and great fit. It's very comfortable and I love wearing it! The black is a beautiful black, not faded or anything like that. I have a big bust and love wearing men's shirts because of the sleeves (feminine fits are too short sleeved for me). And this fits great!",

I ordered a medium and would estimate that it is more like \"small-and-a-half,\" if that makes sense... I still would have given this 5 stars but the color is not as shown in the photos. What I received for the olive shirt is a much darker green. I also ordered the gray and it, too, is much darker. I wanted the much more faded look shown in the photos. Maybe in 50 washes they will look like the photos?",

I decided to purchase this shirt being that its been in my wishlist for a while based off the design. I was surprised with it, very little to no stretch but the material is breathable which is great when working out. I ordered an XL and it did run just a bit big compare to other XL shirts but it wasn't enough to make me return it. The Zipper pocket is nice to be able to keep your keys and carry your earbuds when at the gym. The side pockets are a bit small as i struggle to put my hands in, almost feels like i will tear the material. The hood is made if the same breathable material which is nice to help build a sweat. The sleeves are cut off a bit high up on the arm but im guessing to give the flexibility for the muscles. Overall i give it 3 stars, for the price you really cant go wrong without paying big on big name brands.\nIt is very comfortable and definitely nice whether your lifting heavy weights or going on a nice jog. Would possibly purchase again in a different color.",

          "I was a little worried because of what my mind thinks of when I think of \"poplin\" shirts....but this is very much like what the old Navy (not Old Navy the store) shirts sailors used to wear with bell bottom jeans. And it fits just right. Big note here....I've been on a diet and have lost 20 lbs....I've ALWAYS since my 20s worn a Large.....I'm in my 60s and as of late ANY large button down on me has been too tight on my belly and very uncomfortable....but happy to say now a large fits me great again....so all that said....if you have a gut, men....be real and get an XL, it might fit looser, but with a wife beater tee under it and un-tucked with Levis it'll look great. 'Nother note: it's NOT a wrinkle free fabric, so take necessary actions when washing....like don't dry it on HOT, (or wash it in HOT...with today's detergents there's no need to anyway) and hang it on a hanger as soon as you take it out....IOW....treat it like a dress shirt, not a rag!",
          "T",
          "This is a good shirt both comfort and appearance-wise. I am not into the denim look but this light rinsed chambray look is perfect. It is not wrinkle-free but doesn't wrinkle all that badly.",

I would liken the XL to most other brandsâ large and even medium. The disappointment is exacerbated by just how thin the material is, so it really shows off ALL of your excess weight if your chest, arms, and stomach are larger.\n\nUltimately, it depends on how you carry your weight and where excess weight shows; if your stomach is less bulky youâll probably find these shirts to be well-fitting.",

I would highly recommend that you pay a little more for a higher quality product.",

They size large, so for a tight fit, one size smaller is an option. After washing, I dropped the rating from a 4 star to 3, because the shirts shrunk in length, and the neck hem folded over.

Iâm ordering the XL black to see the difference. The large seems to match âsize chartâ nicely. Chaz",
          "Not the softest material, but the \"L\" is a reasonably flattering cut, with enough material for taller people, without floppy sleeves.\n\nOn my 5'11\" average-to-athletic build, it's not as tight as most athletic brands, not clinging to my belly, and breaking at the hip. It doesn't pull around the shoulders, either--nice!\nSleeves end cleanly at the wrist bone, with enough material for somebody 6'1\" to reasonably wear it. I also tried the \"XL\" which would have been called a \"tall\" cut in any other brand, much longer in the body without being excessively baggy.\n\nThe coarse material makes this not my favorite shirt, but it's cut so I could layer over it OR under it, and it fits well. Recommended.",

Large frame, broad shoulders, mostly HWP. The XL fit very well - slightly loose, but not baggy. Not like a compression shirt. The problem, as noted by others, is the neck opening. I don't have an unusually thick neck, its proportionate to the rest of my body. The shirt hung well on my frame, but the front of the neck hole rested up against my throat. That might not bother some folks, but I had to return. I can't handle stuff like that resting on my throat.",
          "I like these shirts--they're comfortable and seem to be good quality. However, the sizes are not consistent. I bought 3 medium shirts-- one red, one olive and one black. The red one is smaller than the others--smaller neck, narrower chest, and shorter length. The olive one is almost the same as the black one--same neck and chest size, but it's shorter in length than the black one. So you might want to order more than one size and return the one that doesn't fit.",

Pretty light and something I will wear under short sleeve shirt on cold days when playing soccer or as base layer when running. Nice grey, almost blue in some respects.\nIf you want something super tight I would say order size down.",
          "The material is what makes this shirt extra nice. It is soft and thin, but thick enough to keep you comfortable on cooler days. And, the neckline is very well done (a particular peeve of mine). Too many of these \"active\" shirts have necklines that stretch out after just 3-4 washings. This one is holding up really well. And, like the fit in general, it's the perfect size (I'm a standard large; it's a perfect fit large for me). Sleeve length and all.",

This shirt is the closest I've found to my ideal. It's light, drapes well withouth compressing or accentuating my less than six pack, and is not at all baggy. Very comfortable too. I hang it to dry, so the thing should last me decades. I may grab another one.",
          "Material has decent quality fabric, however, the midsection is very loose. The shoulder and arms for great but the midsection was so loose that the shirt hangs off of me.\n\nBottom line: the midsection needs to be tapered in these shirts. Too loose",

          "Big fan of these shirts so far. A couple things to know:\n\n-They are \"Stay Tucked\" because they are longer. A lot longer. In the photo, I am comparing these to a Hanes ComfortFit shirt, and you can really see the size difference.\n-In the roughly 2/3 months of wearing these, they have stayed pretty soft!\n-The sleeve size is pretty small. This is important if you wear a lot of polos as you don't want your sleeve of your undershirt sticking out. Has not been a problem for me with any of my polos. (see photo for sleeve size).\n\nOverall, I really like these. I wasn't sure about the extra length but it really does help my undershirt stay tucked and not bunch around my waistband, an issue I've had with other undershirts.",
          "I",
          "I am one of those old-school middle-aged guys who wears a white t shirt under my dress shirts to work every day. I'm typically somewhere around a medium or large in size, kind of on the borderline between the two. I usually buy size medium undershirts so that they will actually fit under my dress shirts (larges are typically too lose around the midsection for me). However, lately I have noticed that size medium undershirts in some brands feel a bit too tight and small to be comfortable. I decided to try these Fruit of the Loom ones based on reviews stating that these run a bit big for their size. While they seem fairly standard in the chest and shoulders for a size medium, what I find is that they run longer than other brands. This is a good thing for me, because they actually do stay tucked in while some of the competitor brand ones do not. These undershirts also have some stretch to them so they don't feel restrictive. All-in-all a pretty good fit and a good value at this price. If you are looking for a basic white t shirt to wear under a dress shirt or polo and are between sizes, this may be a good option for you.",
          "Pros:\n- Very inexpensive - the price is more than fair for what you get\n- Pretty good quality from what I can tell (not scratchy/loose strings)\n- Extra length so they stay tucked\n\nCons:\n- They shrink an insane amount after just the first wash\n- They get a bit less comfortable the more times you wash them no matter how expensive your detergent/fabric softener is\n- They're very thin\n\nThere's not much to say about this exactly. They are just regular shirts but with an extended length so they stay tucked in under a dress shirt. Functionally, they work great - I've even bought a second package just because they do what they're meant to and they do it well. The only problem I have with them is that they shrink a lot after just the first wash. I guess that's where the extra length comes in handy though - if any other shirt shrank this much then there would be a problem.\n\nI wear a button up shirt to work every day and these shirts have never done me wrong. I actually hate wearing any other regular white shirt under my button up's. They usually end up rising up too much and bunching up around the waist - not a good look.\n\nIn the end - I put that they do fit as expected. I would say that brand new they fit as they should. Though, if I was you - I'd probably size up and wash them as soon as you get them, you'll probably end up with a better experience. Overall though, they're pretty thin so I would probably feel a bit weird just wearing them standalone - but they're great as an undershirt. What more could you really even ask for? Yeah quality is nice, but if it's going under your shirt, who really cares? Spend the extra money on a better shirt to go over it and thank me later.",
          "I have purchased 5 packs of these t-shirts and counting. They are the perfect length once they go through the wash and dryer. 90% of other t-shirts I have historically purchased are too short once they go through the dryer (the dryer is set to its lowest setting).\n\nI constantly tell people about these amazing shirts.\n\nA fresh t-shirt a day can change your life. Simplicity and beauty. Gates, Jobs and Zuckerberg all believed in a simple wardrobe. There is less for me to think about when I wake up and get dressed, because I already know a fresh white t-shirt awaits.",
          "Unfortunately not the ones I thought they were - as I sturdy have Fruit of the Loom Stay Tucked tees that have lasted through numerous washing cycles in the past year. Although the size was right, the fabric on these shirts was much less resilient, thin and transparent-like. For something that costs roughly US$ 6, they're definitely not worth GBP 20.",
          "I got a medium as a tie dying project with my younger cousin. Size was a lot smaller than i thought it would be (my brother is usually a medium and likes his shirts loose, i based it off this. I wanted a shirt that would hang near my thighs) The fit ended up just a regular mens small to me.\n\nIm 5ft 3\", length reaches upper-mid bum.\nMy cousin is 5ft 6\" and it fits her perfectly.",
          "if you are not a super tall man, these are too long for wearing under dress clothes. i am not tall or a man, but i bought these for my boyfriend who never wears them because of the fit. to other women out there thinking of buying these for someone else, the length of an under shirt apparently only matters if youâre the size of a nordic viking.",
          "Bought these to wear under my work t-shirts, and the fit wonderfully. I am a 5'8 female, about 220 pounds, and I opted for the XL. After shrinking a bit in the wash, they fit excellent. I am an electrician, and work overhead quite a bit, and I can go all day without having them come un-tucked. Nice and light, and the sleeves fit tight to the arm, so they aren't bunching up under the sleeve of your over-shirt. Also have a low enough collar that they don't stick out under a standard tshirt. Would definitely buy again."

The shirt was long enough that if you do any overhead exercises, your belly would not show (i.e. shoulder press, pull ups, etc.) According to reviews on other shirts, others complained about the collar being to wide. The collar fit on this shirt is perfect around the neck isn't too wide or choking. I was also able to wear a neoprene sauna vest underneath and it completely concealed it. This shirt is an athletic fit, so for those who may have a belly, it might wrap or expose around it. The only very minor issue was some of the excess threads, which can be easily removed by cutting it. This would be a great gift for any runner or gym-goer!",
          "I read many reviews and some complaints, but these shirts are good. They fit right, nice and comfortable, and they breathe well too. Of course, the purpose of the breathable fibers isn't some mystical property that dries your skin, but keeping one comfortable while sweating heavily while doing strenuous activity, and that's these in a nutshell. And yes, there are no labels or any print indicating which side to wear these on, but there is a trick. All you have to do is make sure that the tag near the bottom of the shirt is on the left side, then the shirt is on correctly. That said, these are great for cycling and I plan on buying more for the near future. Just great these shirts!",

If cotton was still being picked by hand, this single XL shirt would contain one or two cottonpickers' entire lifetime of work. It's bigger than big, it's huge.",
          "Normally I wear a size large T shirt so I ordered the large. It was a little too big so I ordered a Medium. When the Medium arrived it was exactly the same size as the large, so I ordered a Small. When the Small came it was exactly the same size as the Medium and the Large. There is only one size they are just marked with S.M.L. Since I only use these for working in the yard it's not a big deal, but all of them are the same size.",
          "Once again, not disappointed with the Carhartt shirts I purchased to be embroidered for our construction business. Hunter Green pictured on top of Carbon Heather, Dark Cobalt Blue, and then the navy, all Carhartt brand and original fit. Size LARGE men's and the size is 24 inches under the arm and 32 inches long- from the top of the shoulder to the bottom of the shirt. Also bought some size large Guilden brand shirts, and the Carhartt is an inch wider, longer, and the arms are way wider as well. Great quality and I know from past purchases that they hold up with heavy use and heavy washing.",
          "I have tried on all three sizes trying to find the size that fits me best. I have ordered a small, medium and large. I posted a picture of the large and the medium so you can see the difference the black shirt is the Large and the dessert color shirt is the medium. Iâm 5,11 and 180-185lbs. Personally the medium fit me the best and will order more medium Carhartt shirts in the future. These shirts have a baggy feel around the sleeves but thatâs what I like about them. If that not youâre style you probably wonât like these shirts. In terms of length they are slightly longer then most shirts but itâs not by much.",
          "I love the shirt and it's really nothing I just like about it except for that I paid 17 and then I get a email saying I could have got it for $12 same shirt but I guess that's my own fault being stupid or it's just the way that you guys gets me to buy more stuff after the fact that I don't need anymore so I don't know I love the shirt good shirt it's a durable shirt which I like I will buy again but can't afford to buy anymore broke I would say it's off to work I go but I'm disabled So going to take me quite a while to pay off the bill",
          "The sizes are unlike any other manufacturer I've purchased from. These shirts don't just run large, mine seemed to be SEVERAL sizes larger than what was indicated on the label. Despite being \"regular fit\" this thing fits like a tarp, and the length goes all the way past my knees, it's ridiculous. This shirt is so oversized it's laughably bad. Not only does it look terrible, but it would be impossible/dangerous to work in because the loose, draping fabric is just begging to get caught on anything and everything. I've loved Carhartt stuff for years, but something is has gone seriously wrong with their design and manufacturing. I won't buy this brand ever again.",
          "I realize there are so many reviews on this product this probably wonât get looked at much but...These are my absolute favorite shirts of all time. Iâm 6â4â, 225lbs and itâs so incredibly difficult to find a shirt that fits a tall man. Regular T-shirts run way way too short, they arenât meant for us.\nThe XLT fits me great in the summer and the 2XLT fits me in the winter after Iâve put on a few lbs after thanksgiving. The tall sizes are spot on and it only took me 40 years to find a shirt that fits properly. Also they are a thick heavy shirt so they work great for me, for work and out and about.\nAt 17 bucks itâs literally a steal, I would highly, highly recommend!!!",

          "Big fan or Carhartt. I love every product of theirs that I own. I am only putting this rating up to hopefully have someone investigate a potential product issue. I believe that a bunch of 3XL shirts in black were mislabelled or some other defect. I have initiated a return for this product. If you check the picture I uploaded the grey shirt is a normal 3XL, the black shirt is also labelled as 3XL, but you'll notice it is significantly smaller. Another review commented with the same issue, so I would be wary of ordering this shirt in black until this issue is solved and the erroneous products are replaced. I own a bunch of Carhartt items in this size and the Carhartt Mens Big & Tall Workwear Pocket Short-Sleeve T-Shirt Original Fit K87 has been the only one way off in size, which leads me to believe there is a mislabel. Thanks!",
          "Carhartt quality is some of the best out there. This t-shirt is amazing quality made from some heavy duty cotton. However (and this is not necessarily carhartts fault) I have a long back so bought norm size but in the long. this t-shirt swamps me totally. Definitely buy one size down from normal maybe two. This thing is huge. Otherwise great."

If you can see in the picture, both are actually labeled as XL. This is after one wear each, no washing ever, only 2 days or so after I received them. So just be aware you might receive a similar faulty batch.",

I would recommend to anyone thatâs lookin for a decent cheap athletic shirt is a 5-Pack at $30 isnât bad! I wear it during martial arts training, basketball, BLX Bike rides, just wearing about the house yard work etc... I love this product a lot.\nThis runs a lil big, glad I ordered a small size normally I like to where a medium but this brand fits like a medium but I order small. Iâm 5-10 170lbs. Shirt length is 5 inches below the belt line and above your (You Know What)!!! Lol\nI definitely recommend this brand considering only wear during indoors and summer time not a bad investment for $30!\nHigh Recommended!!!",
          "You definitely get what you pay for with these. I wanted to like these very badly because of the material and how comfortable they are. I bought 2 packs, the solid colors and the other various non-solid color ones. First impression was WOW these feel great. Then I tried on another and was like, hmmm this one has a tight collar and I find myself trying to pull it down. Some of the arm holes were even different sizes. Some collars were \"bacony\" already and I could tell that after a few washes this would become very problematic, especially if you are constantly pulling down to relieve a tight collar. I had to be careful when taking off or putting on hangers and while taking the shirts off because it felt like I would stretch the collar permanently or rip a seam when taking it off. One of the shirts was DRASTICALLY too small. I bought a size large and it fit like a medium. Overall, 1/10th of them were too small. Around 4/10 of them felt like they had too tight a collar. The shoulder stitches are off and don't fit snug around the shoulders. All of them had shoulder seams that stuck up and bothered me (and I have built shoulders/traps). One of them even had what appeared to be dirt on them.\n\nFinal decision was made after trying on all shirts multiple times and determining that after a few washes these would be useless. For 6 bucks each I did not feel that they would even be worth the few wears you would get before having to toss them. Made in Egypt. Save your time and money and try something else.",

This shirt is cut so as to not be blobby but also not too form fitting. It seems to be slightly narrower than most XXLs which for me is a good thing.\n\nThe length of these shirts seem slightly longer than normal. I found the regular was just right and the tall was just a little bit too long. But since I just throw my shirts in the washer and dryer (I know) I will keep both to see if the fit changes. If the tall size shrinks up a little bit the length will be perfect for me.\n\nI'm always looking for drifit type shirts that have a little heft to them in order to not reveal every aspect of my chest. Unfortunately they are impossible to find since manufacturers keep making them wafer thin. Although somewhat thin, I like these particular shirts because the pattern in them have a sort of concealing effect.\n\nThe photos show the length of the regular and the tall size inside the regular to show it's about 2.5\" or so longer.",

In other words a perfect all around fit.\n\nI can't promote these enough, got my first shirt roughly 3 years ago and keep buying them anytime I see them under $20. The original shirts look just as good as this shirt I just purchased.\n\nI wear them each weekly as I will only wear these and they've never frayed, faded, torn, or shown any signs of again aside from one shirt had the logo peel off.

I've never worn athletic shirts before, so I wasn't sure what to expect or how effective it would be.\n\nFirst, the shirt is incredibly comfortable. On a 2.5 hour ride, it never chaffed or rubbed the wrong way. I purchased it in white, so it did a great job at reflecting the sunlight and keeping me cool. I was also pretty impressed at how quickly the shirt dried (and I sweat A LOT). Within about 20 minutes of me finishing my ride, the shirt was pretty dry.\n\nI would definitely recommend buying a size up from what you currently wear since these shirts run slightly small.

Finding nice dress-up clothes that he is willing to wear can be very difficult. He was glad to try it on and commented on how soft the shirt felt. He really liked the shirt and promised to wear the shirt every Sunday. I found the color (Denim Large Plaid) to be a beautiful collection of blues. I purchased adult medium and it fit my boy great. He has a longer upper torso and it covered him well with room to continue to growing upward. -without looking like the shirt overwhelmed him. I'll be buying more.",

          "I originally got one for work because it said it was breathable and I work outside in 90+ degree weather with high humidity for most of the year. It is the most comfortable and breathable polo I have ever owned. I now own 5 and wear them everyday. I would high recommend them! I was them on warm and run them through the dryer with no shrinking or break down yet. I am 6 ft 1 and weigh 215lbs. I got Lg shirts and they fit perfect.",
          "I'm 5'9\" and 220 lbs (all in my stomach). I'm at that awkward weight where sometimes Large is too tight and sometimes X-Large is too big. Via Prime Wardrobe, I bought this in XL and LG - the LG was a little snug while the XL fit perfectly (though slightly more length than I would like). I would rate this as \"true to size\". Very comfortable and virtually wrinkle free. If you're not on a tight budget, I would definitely recommend this for the price if you appreciate soft, comfortable, polyester polo sport shirts.",
          "The golf polo isn't my ideal style, but it strikes a balance between the casualness of a tee and the effort of a button-down, especially for daytime wear.\n\nThe material in this version is a little thicker physically than I expected (a good thing, no undershirt required) , but surprisingly breathable and cool wearing through the magic of technical fabrics.\nI wore it through an entire day, heavily outdoors, during the peak of the sticky South Florida summer, and was more comfortable than I expected to be. It also doesn't seem to stain or sweat through very easily. Pleasing.\n\nPricing seems to vary, but these shirts are a bargain at the occasionally lower price on some color. They also work well for the new Work-From-Home normal, where you want an easy-wearing shirt with a collar for those Zoom calls.\n\nI have several of this shirt, and one of them has lasted through multiple wear&wash cycles, without any signs of pilling or deterioration. Highly Recommended.",
          "These are very comfortable shirts. The material is silky smooth on the skin. The fit provides plenty of room for moving around yet they still have a fitted look- Great for middle aged guys that stays in good shape. Love the color selection. These shirts really look great. My only complaint - They will run if you snag them on anything sharp. I avoid wearing them when I'm working around the house, fishing or playing with my cats. If you get a small run from let's say your fingernail it can be easily worked out by stretching the fabric across the run while rubbing the run with your finger. Then stretch in the other direction while rubbing the fabric. But a big long run - can't do much about that.",
          "My husband loves this shirt but after only one washing it came apart on the left side at the seam . I have purchased these before with no problems and disappointed with this one. I'm in the process of sewing the seam but for the price of these shirts I shouldn't have to be fixing it.",
          "Love the shirt very comfortable definitely a great shirt to wear when itâs hot and you want to look good.",
          "It was time to replace my old worn Izod polo shirts (typical cotton) which are my go-to work shirts, and I wanted something a little more sporty looking. The Izod polos are a bit heavy, and I need something that has a lighter feel, breathable, for the hot humid weather here in the southeast.\n\nItâll be a few months until that hot humid weather hits, but I can say that these shirts are far more comfortable than those thick heavy Izod polos. These Under Armor polos are made with a fabric that is slightly heavier than a typical athletic/golf polo, so I hope it isnât too heavy for June-July-August. Time will tell. But so far I am very happy with these shirts. They seem to be very well made.",
          "This is my 11th Under Armour Shirt. I have 9 of their heavier sweaters & I like the quality & fit, so I got 2 of their lighter, short-sleeve shirts. I like the way they aren't wrinkled after washing. They don't feel like Polyester; they feel like brushed cotton or silk. And they dry quickly on a hangar. I just ordered 4 more of them in different colors. They arrived today (5-14-21). They also fit perfectly.\nFor size comparison, I'm 5'11\" & 170 lbs. The \"Large\" fits perfectly.",
          "It fits nicely, it is NOT a tight fit. This is not a compression shirt. very good quality. Odor control is exceptional. I am comfortable at many different daily temperatures, and it obviously breaths well. It also looks very nice. The photos on the site do not do it justice. For example the black version, with the grey accent, the photos make the gray look very light, while in real life the grey is darker. I normally like solid single color shirts, but this is one of the few exceptions to this rule in my wardrobe. I am actually very happy with it. The Black isn't the shinny/glossy of most artificial fabrics, but it is also not the flat matte of cotton. This shirt will probably still look nice, in a fashion sense, 10 or even 20 years from now. While not formal, it is nice enough, to be casual office and even casual business attire. I can see going to a good restaurant, with slacks and this shirt and not looking out of place",
          "A",
          "I wrote a review on the navy blue ones that I got. I like it so much, that I got two in the black, despite my being concerned about the gray accents being used. But upon seeing in real life, I was very happy with it. the grey on the black, just like the lighter blue on the navy blue, is actually darker than the photos show. It in fact looks very good. quality construction. Odor control is excellent. Fits according to the size you would normally get. Comfortable for all day use",
          "Like most UA clothing this is really well made and finished. it's a surprisingly heavy weight material but is a very breathable polyester fabric rather than cotton. Whilst it is probably a golfing shirt, I bought it for casual cycling in hot weather and it works well for this. The sizing is a bit on the large side though, I'm typically a M or L in a polo shirt, but the medium size was way too large and I had to return it and order a small, which is a great fit. I'd recommend order a size down from your usual.",

I usually go for a poly-blend type of shirt, but this time I tried one of these all cotton ones. The shirts fit well - I tend to have issues with my shoulders, and being able to lift my arms over my head. But I've got a full range of motion with the fit of this shirt. I'm liking the feel of cotton. But I haven't had to deal with any stains yet. I've been throwing these in along with my regular whites, and tumble dry till they are just slightly damp then hang drying. If you don't want wrinkles, you're going to need to do some light ironing. Me, I don't mind wrinkles. Probably going to buy a couple more of these and see if there are any long-sleeve versions.",

The plus is it is nice to the touch, looks great, stitched well, good structure, nice fabric weight (not thin). I recommend for sure. The gray was nice looking. Contemporary and can be dressed up with slacks, or jeans with nice shoes... or dressed down.",

The material is light and decently moisture wicking, but has pretty rough texture and tends to really cling to the body. Towards the end of a medium, 6 mile run in this shirt, I started feeling a pretty significant chafing discomfort. So one of the main reasons for which I got this shirt didn't work out, therefore I can't recommend it.",
          "Fit perfect. The cut is loose, while still being flattering. The fabric is soft and light. I normally hate any shirt that isn't 100% cotton, but underarmour is a strange exception. These only get more comfortable after wearing and washing. I have a couple of these shirts that are years old and still look new and feel amazing.",
          "It is really hard to find shirts in Under Armour that fit my husband because they run very small. They do not make much in a 4x size as he usually wears a 3x in other brands but they are too short and too tight. When I returned them to the store the clerk said everything in Under Armour runs small as they are made for athletes who work out all the time and are in shape. He said to always go up a size in shorts and running shorts always get a 10 inch length unless you run track. He was very helpful. I wish Under Armour would take note they would sell more shirts if they made more color selection and shirt selection in 4x since not just athletes want to buy their products as they limit the market by a lot by doing this. I just want others to know that we had to order, take what did not fit to the store and get a refund and then reorder online because they do not carry larger sizes in the store.",
          "This is an alright shirt, as the fit is good (good length, nice fit in the body, longer tail). However the quality of the fabric seems to be lacking. I've worn the shirt just 3 times and it already has a couple very small pulls in the fabric. I've never had an Under Armour shirt pull this easily. It makes me wonder if this is an authentic shirt or just a fake.",
          "I really like the way most under armor shirts fit and breath but this one is truly exceptional! Actually the first day I wore this shirt I got a bloody nose and it washed out completely most likely due to the higher quality polyester fibers. As I referenced these shirts breath very well and this one is so light and airy you donât feel like you are wearing it. Also I sweat profusely when I exercise but this shirt does not become see through. As such itâs still flattering when drenched in sweat. It definitely has an athletic fit that tapers at the waist. I wear a large in almost every brand and the sizing for me is perfect(44chest 32 waist) if you are on the heavier size I would definitely recommend sizing up though. In summation this shirt is worth every penny and I highly recommend it!",
          "So Iâm stupid tall from the waste up. Like. 6â5 from the hips up. And Iâm 250 pounds- 50 inches around at the chest. Shirts donât normally want to fit. Either theyâre way short or the arms are too snug or everything is super baggy like a 4x.\n\nI told you that to tell you this- The shirt fits great!\nOver head presses- No belly showing.\nClings? No binding in the arm pits.\n\nWhy is a shoulder workout so hard to dress for?\n\nBut really. It fits great on a big torso.",
          "Super lightweight and breathes nicely. Not restrictive at all. I'm 5'8\", 150 lbs., and the small fits me perfectly. I don't have a big chest at all, though, so keep that in mind.\n\nI've purchased three of these shirts in various colors. Great for summer/spring/fall runs and working out at home. With so many color choices, you'll have no problem pairing them with your favorite shorts and sneakers.",
          "E",
          "I",
          "I bought a couple of these shirts for the gym and i really like them.\nIn my opinnion they look really nice, the color options are great (even though i went with just black) but most importantly they are very lightweight. When you wear them you will feel very light and they are comfortable.\nSo far i had no problems, even with sweat from training it seems to dry fairly quickly.\nI never used the first models so i can not speak to how they compare but i am very impressed with this and will definitely buy more of this in the future.\nIn terms of size, they are a bit on the loose format so you should take that in consideration, i usually wear M/L and for this case M was perfect.\n\nHeigh: 1.90m\nWeight: 87kg\nSize: M",
          "Nice T shirt but ruined by a sticker on the front that leaves Glue and looks a mess",
          "As a construction worker and outdoorsman I bought these as they dry fast and feel light and breathable while still keeping you warm, theyâre are cheaper alternatives but I buy these normally when they are on sell and if you can get them for around Â£15 and down you canât go wrong Iâve probably got around 15 now and tend to wear them all the time."

          "I am in my mid-20s, 6' 1\" and weigh 158 pounds. I got a medium and fits just like the model. A little long but great for tucking in but can also be worn casually. It's lightweight, wicks sweat away well, and looks good. If you're looking for a polo more compressing, this is not it. It's loose but without the \"dad look\" if you size right.\n\nFor care, I button up the collar, wash inside out in cold war, and air dry. The heat from the dryer will ruin this polo just like any clothing item made of polyester and spandex.\n\nFor long term durability, time will tell.\n\nIt's a great polo compared to more expensive ones. If you have any questions, I will answer.\n\nThank you",
          "This shirt is great for any active or athletic professional. I'm a personal trainer and a massage therapist, and this shirt paired with black gym pants allows me to look professional, while providing total body comfort and flexibility to move and bend freely. The sleeves are a little short, which may be a complaint for some. But they look great if you've got nice biceps.",
          "For the price, I Love this shirt. I bought two and once I received them, I ordered the other colors. I now have 5 total.\nI wear these for a casual dress work attire.\nFits snugly, however, I am a heavier guy. Material is a good feel, definitely a good moisture wick material.\nMy measurements below:\nHeight 5â6â\nWeight:220 lbs.\nWaist 38â\nGut 40â\nChest 49â\nShoulders 55â",
          "Love the Polo it fits exactly as expected and looks amazing. I'm 6'3 and 200 lb slim build. I wasn't sure if I should get a large or a medium. Medium was definitely the way to go. Very natural fit material looks ð",
          "Bought this for my husband, he really liked the fit and feel of this shirt. He wears and xlg and it fit him perfectly. He was happy won the length and the feel of the sleeves.",
          "Like most reviews here I don't have a problem with these shirts. They're comfy and seem to be well made. On occasion there has been some excess string hanging after a wash but it doesn't seem to affect the shirt at all. I bought one of each color in medium. The collar is perfectly fine, I'm not sure what others are complaining about. Overall, if you need some decent casual and comfy collared shirts this is the way to go. I'm 5'8\" and skinny at 135 lbs. The medium size fits me just fine.",
          "Think of it this way, you spend the same amount on a branded shirt made of inferior material that will fade and shrink after one day of use. I don't think shirts are supposed to last forever either. Even if this shirt is a one time use, it looks nice the first time you use it, as opposed to getting shirts somewhere else that don't fit. I'm very satisfied with the way this one fits. Not too tight and not too loose. The material is also good. I bought this shirt to look nicer for work and I think it will do the job. I will be ordering more as this is my to go shirt for now. I bought based on the reviews left by others, trust me you will be happy with this shirt. It is an easy $40 dollar shirt if it was sold at a physical store.",
          "So far, great shirt for the $. Washed twice. No shrinkage. Few wrinkles when hung to dry. 3 minutes in the dryer solved that. I wear it for golf. Moisture wicking is great on very hot day. Was concerned the length might be too short because I wear tucked in for golf. No problems. Fit is excellent, cut on the slimmer side. Iâm 5ââ 11â with a 33 waist and 41 inch chest, weigh 168. it was excellent not baggy. Not tight. I read it ran small or tight for a medium and several reviews advised to go up a size. I order the large first time and although ok, it was a bit too loose in the waist and chest and shoulder seams rode an inch or so down. I returned for the medium and perfect fit. I like collar, itâs creased firmly at the seam and wonât roll. Overall, a great value and I ordered again in green. Out of stock for other colors or would have ordered more. Long years wear is a question. Weâll see.",
          "I bought 2 of these shirts, one in grey . I returned one and had it replaced, due to the top outside corner of the shoulder seams , donât lie flat. All three of these shirts do the same thing. Looks like I have small horns on my shoulders. Fit and fabric are nice.",
          "This is teeny tiny. I bought a 3xl, and I normally wear an xl, and it was so small I couldnt get it on!\nCome on, if you are selling in North America, then make the sizes true to size, no some sort of Asian sizes.\nIts too bad, because it is a beautiful shirt",
          "I wanted to like this shirt. It looks good and the fabric feels comfortable, although pretty thin. But I can't find a size that fits. And the sleeves are way too long. First I tried a medium, as this is the size I usually wear. I was swimming in a medium. So I returned it and got a small. The small was way too tight, while the sleeves were still slightly too long.",
          "I am 6'4\", 230, the XL fits well, a little loose, but you tuck these into shorts or pants and they are perfect. Best Polo shirt buy out there. Unless you golf more than 3x a week, this is all you need. Buy one, I bet you buy more. It isn't the best shirt ever made (form fit wise), but you pay 20$ rather than 90$. Material is light and comfortable.",
          "I wear this shirt predominantly for hiking. Itâs fabric is very noticeable synthetic, but has a smoother finish than most of my Nike DriFit polos. I find this fits somewhere between a Nike and a Lululemon polo. Itâs slightly slim fit, but definitely closer to the larger fitting Nike in terms of fit. I still donât find the cut / fit incredibly flattering but for hiking in the woods itâs definitely alright."

Based on many reviews I read regarding size I ordered a medium when I normally wear a large. This is totally incorrect advice. Maybe the sizing is different on my order, but medium was a very tight fit. I'm a fairly normal size person and I tuck the shirt in so I'm not concerned with the length but I am returning the medium for the large I normally wear and will update this in a few days, but I'm sure large will be fine!

Because aaaaaaalllll of the womens polos are waaaaaaaaayyyy too short to stay tucked in. These bad boys though... these will stay tucked in with plenty of extra material left over to be comfortable.

It's like a supermarket garment. Not very stylish or fitted. And the colour is way off what the photo shows. It's much more green in real life. Adequate but disappointing.",

Size and placement great.\n\nForewarned about shrinkage, I ordered large instead of medium. âOut of the boxâ i put the black T on a table and measured it.\n\nShoulder, seam to seam was 48.5 cm, length (rear neck to bottom) was 81 cm and width (mid chest) was 54 cm. All of the shirts have now been washed 2x, (before and after wearing). Temperature setting was warm/cold. Set the dryer to normal and removed them when completely dry. Shoulder lost 3.5 cm (abt 1.4â); length was shorter by 6 cm (abt 2.4â) and the width was narrower by 3.5 cm (abt 1.4â).\n\nThe heads-up on shrinkage was most appreciated. Starting out with large instead of medium was the way to go. The t-shirts now fit just right, they are all very comfortable. Colors have yet to fade and did not bleed as laundered\n\nIf you are looking for a good T with pocket for warm climate â shorts and t-shirt weather â look no more.",

They stay tucked if you do decide to go that route.\n\nArms come about halfway past my bicep.\n\nThin, almost too thin for the lighter colors. Definitely breezy. A bit stretchy.\n\nShirts come rolled up and taped like underwear, which apparently stressed the top of the pocket on this one out too much, as it was machine pressed and wont lay flat.\n\nNot a deal breaker as mostly these are undershirts, but still kinda wonky.",

          "I typically wear a medium. But having had prior experience with this brand, I ordered them in large. And, as expected, after just one washing they shrunk to a medium and fit me perfectly. And about the sleeves. A few people have remarked that these short sleeves are a bit shorter than they ought to be. But for me that's a plus, as I always roll up the sleeves on my T-shirts anyway. Bottom line, if you can deal with the color selection and the aforementioned issues, this multipack is a pretty good deal",
          "I have worn two of the T-shirts and they were nice, but very light material. I was fairly happy with them since I live in Texas and heavy T-shirts get hot. BUT, after washing them they came apart in the wash. The stitching came apart and there were holes in different areas of the shirts. Unless you plan on wearing them only once, or never washing them stay away from these T-shirts....",
          "Almost impossible to find pocket T's any more. What the heck to do about carrying reading glasses, pens, cigarettes (if you smoke), shopping lists, small note pads, etc., etc. These shirts are the answer. They are well made and use a decent quality cotton. I HATE shirts with spandex since it feels like I'm wearing a rubber band. These have NO spandex in them! The neck is great, no rubbing, etc. Why they make red ones is beyond me, but they seem to stick them into most packages. Don't wash the reds with anything else or all your clothes will be pink. The only downside is the shrinkage. As others have commented, they will absolutely shrink upon washing at least one size. If you like them to fit loosely, order 2 sizes larger.\n\nI have bought 25 of these just in case I can never find a T with pockets again. Fruit of the Loom, please don't stop\nbuying these from our friends in El Salvador. They are making a good product at an excellent price.",

You can get it around the 30-ish dollar mark, and get 6 t shirts so thatâs approximately 5 bucks a t shirt so itâs not going to be top class. I find the fit normal but expect it to shrink in wash, have only worn 1 so far. I like the colour they come in and itâs a decent deal for the price youâre paying.",

I understand cotton shrinks but I have other high quality cotton shirts that havenât shrunk yet after years of wear. I returned these as of today , you pay for what you get. Id recommend Hanes over FOTL any day of the week for work shirts/gym shirts they are pre shrunk and mine havenât shrunk yet and they have been washed multiple times"

          "I was skeptical based on the price but pleasantly surprised once I opened the package. The shirts are comfortable, soft, thick(but not too thick) and great quality. I ordered the XL and the actual sizing was spot on. What I find hard to find in a good, quality T shirt is one where the sleeves are of normal length and the trunk of the T isn't too long or too short, and these fit the bill perfectly! Lastly, the fit is a \"standard\" fit, not that body hugging \"fitted\" crap that all shirts seem to be nowadays. For us guys with the \"Dad bods\", these shirts hang nicely and hide the guts, jelly rolls and man boobs that we've worked so hard to aquire over the years. I'll be buying plenty more of these shirts in the future! HIGHLY recommended.",
          "Finally a basic black tshirt in size medium that is long enough ! At 6' 2\" and 175lbs, with a 33\" waist and 37\" chest, this tshirt has a few inches of free space in the chest and is fairly snug at the hips, which is fine given most of my other mediums (other brands) are a bit too short on me. Material is soft. Will wrinkle if you dont take it out of dryer asap but thats on me not the shirt. Recommend !",
          "I was pretty excited (well, as excited as you might get over a t-shirt) to get these. I tried them on and they fit very well. The fabric is soft and colors were as expected. I believe the description stated these have a chest pocket - they don't. It also stated there was 40% (I think) polyester in it. The tags on mine stated the t-shirts were 100% cotton. After the 1st wash, they still fit pretty good. I could tell it was a little smaller but it was still good. After the 2nd wash though they shrunk to the point where my ample belly was nearly showing. A bare mid-riff was not the look I was going for. So, I think these would be a great t-shirt if they fixed the shrinkage issue or....... if you want to show off your belly.",
          "H",
          "The shirt was wayyy too short. Went from tight fit to Winnie the Pooh in a matter of a simple reach although entertaining on my part my husband didnât think it was funny. Rated it five stars because it was sooo soft and for the gut busting laughter it brought on when he reached.",
          "Next time I will order a large rather than an XL. I'd rather wear a shirt a little too big than one that's too small. I think large would be just right. I love the softness of the cotton, and the color is beautiful. I've never bought a t-shirt of this quality for under $30.",

          "Review after 1 wash.\nSize Large/Color Blue\nFor comparison Iâm 215lbs 38â waist.\n\nSome shrinkage but overall held up very well. I like the length of the shirt, hangs below the belt.\nOn me it reaches the bottom of the fly on my jeans.\nNo noticeable color fade.\nI ordered 2 more in red!",
          "I",
          "Tshirts are a good quality and fit really well. Only downside is the colour on the picture is not quiet the colour I got. Said bright blue t-shirts that came are more a dark turquoise. I brought these for my daughter to wear at school, but due the colour not being right she can not.",
          "Good quality but very large! Im normally wear a normal size S Tshirt but these size S would definitely fit a size M. I had to return.",
          "The fabric is really thick and a pleasant soft texture. The main part of the shirt fits really well, but the neck is too narrow and tight on both shirts, and the arms are too baggy. Colour matches the picture.\n\nIt is described as \"Classic-Fit\" on the website, but \"Loose Fit\" on the order confirmation email. It's definitely loose, rather than classic.",
          "Unfortunatly despite following washing instructions (less than 30Â°C wash and tumble dry on low heat) they have both shrank terribly. They were a little large to start with, but having my navel exposed isn't a good look!"

She bought it to replace a shirt I'd been wearing for five years that had gotten so holy it recently started its own religion. The new shirt is lighter than the last, so I can only wear it with lighter pants, but that's okay. I think my girlfriend is tired of me always dressing like a beatnik. If these sound like issues you're dealing with in your household, this shirt is probably for you.",

I do not care for the tight styles young men wear and this shirt is roomy without being overly so. Sleeve length is right on the mark. I've had custom made shirts that did not fit as well. The material is good, not too thick or thin. You can't beat the price for such a nice casual shirt.",

These by fit the best by far (Iâm between a medium and a large which is challenging, but the medium fit perfect and with a slim silhouette). I do wish the shirt length was just a little shorter (just about an inch shorter) as many retailers are going to for untucked looks. I also wonder if the back of the shirt would hang a little nicer with a âcenter pleatâ rather than two pleats on each shoulder blade.",

I ordered the 'Teal Buffalo Check' option and instead of being a nice bright teal and white check, the whole shirt is very dull looking. The 'white' checks are actually a dirty grey colour - please see photo comparison with a white linen shirt ordered at the same time.",

Itâs impossible to see the differences on the models, so Iâm happy to explain what we discovered to save you the same hassle. We ordered 3 different cuts in Columbia menâs field shirts. The seamed fairly comparable in quality and UV protection.\n\nSilver ridge 2.0 long sleeve: runs very small. An XL would not fit at all. Arms are also very slender, you would have to order 1-2 sizes up if you have large biceps. A very very slim fit.\n\nBonehead shirt: runs large. An XL fit but was extremely baggy. We are going to keep it, the extra room could be advantageous hiking in hot weather. This is an ideal shirt if you like the loose, baggy look/fit. We could have sized down one size and it would have still fit.\n\nBahama: fits exactly as expected. Tight enough to wear to dinner yet comfortable and roomy enough to wear on a hike.\n\nHopefully this information helps you find the right fit and saves you some hassle. Good luck!",
          "I",
          "Love these nylon shirts. Great for warm weather travel. Can be washed out by hand. They dry quickly if the weather isn't too humid, but will usually drive overnight even if somewhat humid. If you don't ring them out, hang them wet, and smooth out the fabric with your hands, they are quite presentable to wear without any ironing. The back yoke is vented. Front breast pockets have Velcro to secure the flaps and drain holes in case you go in the drink. Button-down collar. So many colors to choose from too and I've received many complements from friends and strangers when wearing a pleasant bright color. The shirt's color will fade slightly after repeated washing, but you could minimize this by not machine washing. The slight fading is not a big deal in my opinion for a pastel casual travel shirt. Obviously, you won't have that issue with white or some of the very dark colors. These shirts are very light to pack and can be rolled and placed in packing cubes. I'm hoping Columbia keeps making these for some time to come. Last word - these shirts run a bit large. I usually like to purchase all my shirts in size 'Large' since I prefer my shirts a bit loose fitting, but in the case of these Bahama II shirts, I've order them in size Medium and they fit perfectly.. Still loose fitting, but not overly big. I suggest ordering one size smaller than you usually wear.",

XL fits perfectly, I put that in because most people put an extra large fits great but they donât say how big they are ,..so itâs really no help\nSo I hope that helps . This isnât like the Tech shirt, itâs more of a cotton type shirt, but itâs stretchy, the Tan is Tan, not brown or too light, just Tactical Tan.",
          "I've seen other reviews on here that mention how the shirt has changed and I completely agree. It's as if they keep trying to find ways to cut costs at the expense of the consumer. If you bought this shirt about a year ago or so, it was amazing. Now, it is much thinner and shorter all around (trunk length and sleeve length). After one wash and drying on low, it's now too small; a problem I didn't have with the old version. It feels like a cheap undershirt now. Another customer lost...",
          "Not recommended, under armour is no longer the quality used to be, had ordered almost 200. Worth and returned all. Sadly all was bad cheap quality. Love their heatgear although this was bad quality on all.",

          "I was resistant when reading some bad reviews, but so far it looks great. No holes, no wear. Very comfortable. Might run a tad big. I bought a Medium and I am 6'1 and fits perfect.",
          "The t-shirt is real Under Armour, the fit and material are as described. The tricky part is finding a discount on some sizes, but most are prices week below what youâll find on store shelves. Not much else to say, itâs the real thing.",
          "I bought an UA Tshirt with the FISH Logo Style #1331201- prior to buying these Tshirts. The Fish Logo shirt was 60% cotton/40% polyester. My husband loved the shirt and the fit. He said he wanted more of these but plain black. So I did some research and found these black t-shirts and made sure they were the same material - which they claimed they were 60% cotton/40% polyester. When I received the shirts after pulling one out of the package I immediately noticed a difference and thought the company shipped the wrong shirts. They felt like womens nylons, that is how thin they were. I am not a huge UA fan, but my husband is for their quality and this is so disappointing. I can buy better quality at a box store. Seriously UA, you failed miserably by cutting corners with this. I guess you got caught and had to lower the price. I haven't decided if I'm going to return all of these I bought. You are going to lose a lot of customers if you cut corners with your other products. People pay a lot of money for your quality - keep it like that.",
          "I got this so I could look like Antony Joshua, Iâm nearly there! Iâve just got 2 stone to lose, I need to be 12 years younger, grow 10â taller and get me a tan",
          "Either it's not genuine or they've penny pinched so much it's not recognisable. So thin I can see through it! Might stand in for a mesh vest if you go to that sort of club but not my scene. Frankly I think they're fakes.\nI've got better Â£2 t-shirts from Primark. Returning.\nSome photos added old worn out genuine one on the left. Still much thicker than this new one. On portrait Look the seem where its double thickness. It's White. Now look at the rest of it it's skin colour! In the right light you can totally see areolae.\nHope you don't want your nipples to show.",
          "Ordered a black and got a white. Very thin material which is see through. Nice fit but as another review says, better quality at primark and this is meant to be UA!!!",
          "It's just a t-shirt but they look good, fit is great, and are perfect for a workout. I ordered 2 at the beginning of the summer and lived in them so much I got 2 more. If I had to find some fault I was a bit surprised how much sweat showed through on the dark material, but hey, it's a workout!",
          "You wouldn't think this product wouldn't last more then 2 months. While it still fits well and washes well, the stitches are so weak they have disintegrated already. I now am forced to wear it to my gardening time. I have paid a lot less for products in tier-2 brands that have lasted far longer."

          "Iâm 6ft 190. If this was any smaller I would not like it. It fits like a well fitted t-shirt. Itâs not like a compression shirt. Iâd go for a large if I wanted the compression look. All the negative reviews are mostly because of the size. I think it fits great. The grey shirt is thicker than the others. Quality is like underarmour without the huge price tag.",
          "I'm very happy with them. I got the dark grey (\"black\"), light grey, and blue versions, and the colors are nice; even the blue is understated and classy looking - nothing garish at all. I hate the \"look at me!!\" kinda colors, and the ones I got definitely don't have that kind of aesthetic. The fabric is a stretchy, spandex kinda material, kind of like a compression shirt, though perhaps not quite THAT stretchy and probably a bit thinner than a true compression shirt, but it they feel solid enough. They actually have a pretty nice weight to them. They are surprisingly soft and smooth to the touch too. The hood fits well enough (not that I'm ever going to use it), and the shirt itself fits exactly how I wanted. I've got a pretty average physique; 5'11\", 200lbs, broad shoulders, some definition in the chest and arms with like...a four pack and a bit of pudge on my lower abs, and these shirts (medium size) fit really nicely. They have form-fitting sleeves that make my arms look big, which I like cuz they're not really very big at all. The fabric is stretchy enough that the sleeves are not restrictive but if you've got HUGE arms you might want to go a size up. When I wear these shirts, they're stretched just a bit across the chest, then more relaxed in the abdominal area, and hang about 1 - 1.5 inches below my waist line. I'd say if you have a big chest or more of a round belly you'll probably want a size up. I definitely like the hoodie look, and it even provides a small amount of padding when I do squats. I was a bit nervous that the fabric of the hood would destabilize the bar, but it wasn't an issue at all. Just kept it from rubbing on my back as much. Pretty nice. I got a bit hotter than I anticipated while working out. Like I said, the fabric is tightly woven like a compression shirt, which will keep you cool but you have to get it wet first. I don't sweat much, so I got a bit hotter than I do when I wear mesh or cotton tees, but it wasn't bad. Just warmer. The one thing I don't like is the draw string. Don't get me wrong, it's actually good quality, and even has metal ferrules, but the darn things swing around a lot and are quite distracting, especially when doing cardio. Will be pulling them out soon, as they are completely unnecessary and kinda irritating. Still, I'm impressed with the overall quality of these shirts. I just got them, however, so I don't know how well they'll hold up, but for 30 bucks I will buy more if I think I need more. Really like the style and the fit.",
          "This product fits well and moves with my body during my workouts. It breathes nicely and absorbs sweat and then drys quickly. It has a good cut for your shoulders and biceps without binding under your pits. Also, it has a good length of the shirt so when you are doing overhead lifts and lats you are not showing your belly/abs...",
          "(Ignore my dirty mirror) A lot of clothing online looks better fitting or more vibrant than they really are. This are very impressive. Better than I figured they would be. The double stitch on the arms are a little weird but over all I love it.",
          "Very impressed for the price. The material is light and quick dry as advertised, stretchy so it pulls on and off easily. The insert at the should is a nice touch which makes the fit nice. The size is on the mark, better than and under armor top I bought recently which said XL and fitted M at best. Very impressed and Iâll be ordering more. Iâm sure theyâll do well.",
          "I'm 5'10\" and about 215 lbs. This shirt fits great, is snug enough without being tight, and looks good (the discoloration in the photo is due to a dirty mirror - not the fabric... never take a picture in your teenage son's bathroom!). I exercise daily, and recently moved to an area of the country that is VERY hot and humid, and my home gym is in the screened in porch. I was drenched wearing cotton, and this shirt feels so much more comfortable. Highly recommended!",
          "Finally wore these during working out. And finally washed them also. So on my opinion not a bad performance clothing. It has good material made and after washing it, didn't see a problem.",
          "Received my three pack. My initial reaction is the top is very light weight an comfortable feel on my skin. I preferred the over the shoulder cut rather than above. Too early to tell for durability wear and tear and washable.\nTried on at work for the first time all day, and it was very comfortable. Should be fine for the gym, biking, running, or any working outdoors activities.\nI have a athletic build so the xxl fits perfectly with plenty of room too maneuver. The top absorbs a average sweat well without sticking. The hoodie is good to keep the sun off the back neck or too cover your head when its raining. The black /grey color is more like slate. I really wanted the black with the combo. The price is good..Cool looking too. Highly Recommend."

          "Gildan has a good reputation and I own many printed Gildan shirts. I bought these plain ones to be my plain everyday wear shirts. The fit out of the package was good though they weren't very long. I thought it was something I could deal with since the rest of the shirt fit very well. After one wash (cold water, low heat dry), the shrinkage of all these shirts was astounding. They tightened around the neck, arms, and I lost about two inches of length. Now, I have to wear my pants up high to avoid a crop-top look (trust me, no one wants that). Plus, they faded almost instantly. Next to the 3 year-old black Fruit of the Loom shirts they were supposed to replace they look almost gray. The worst part: I missed the return window, so I have 10 worthless shirts I have to replace. Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!",
          "I bought them for the sole purpose to replace shirts that were too small. They are mainly to wear around the house so part of the reason I bought 10 of the same color. Out of the package, they fit perfect BUT once I washed one, it shrunk 2 inches in length and now fell into the pile of shirts that DON'T fit. Pretty much defeated the purpose of buying new shirts since they were too small. Additionally, I attempted to return them for this reason and was denied because I missed the return window.... It has only been 3 weeks, if that and the policy is FREE returns so another mark against this seller. If their description said that they shrink excessively, shame on me but I don't believe that is the case and now I have 10 shirts that will be donated.",
          "I'm 5 - 10 and weigh 200 pounds - a little on the stout side. Through the years, the Hanes and Fruit of the Loom have become unwearable for me. If I purchase 2x size, they are decent, but not after they have been laundered. After washing, they are mostly unwearable. They become too short, and most of all, they bind in the arm pit. Even new, they are barely long enough to tuck into a waist band. Scratch all that when you purchase a Gildan tee. I ordered 2x and received a tee shirt big enough for me and another half of me. What a treat. It's more than roomy. I didn't send them back for a smaller size. Instead I wore and then washed them. They are still too big even after washing - but they feel great. Large and roomy and soft. Great to purchase a 2x tee and actually receive a 2x tee.",
          "I got one (yes, a SINGLE) dirty T-shirt from China that wasn't even Gildan. Hmm.",
          "Great material. Fit great",
          "So there was no descriptor for \"Fits after washing\". Overall, decent shirts for the price. ($3 each). \"Heavy Cotton\" is somewhat misleading. The fabric was thinner than plain white t-shirts from FotL. I bought 2xl size and after washing they shrunk to about XL so I guessed right about that happening. Nice collars, no stretching out of shape even after fitting over my big noggin.\n\nPros: Good price, good collar\n\nCons: Buy a size up and wash to fit, thin material\n\nOverall: I'd buy again",
          "The LARGE shirt is comfortable, feels and looks durable, and thickness is perfect to go out in public in or to hang out in at the house. I havenât washed the shirts yet, but I suspect they will wash well. Go for it! I bought because my Autism child changes clothes 3-5x a day so we go through 21-35 outfits a week!!!! Laundry at my house is an ongoing battle 24/7.",
          "I just received my 10 shirts. I have worn a lot of Gildan t-shirts over the years and these are not the Heavy Cotton ones. Sure the label says Gildan Heavy Cotton but they are definitely not. The label is different than the usual white Gilden Heavy Cotton label. The label is grey and it says they are made in Nicaragua. If you read the fine print (with a magnifying glass) you will also see that they are imported into Mexico - why are they selling them in Canada? These shirts could not be any thinner - you can see right through them. For $4 a shirt maybe it is what you can expect, however, they were sold as Gildan Heavy Cotton - this is fraudulent. Not sure who is mislabelling them but someone is. These are cheap knockoffs.",
          "It says it's a 10pk, but it isn't.\n\nThey added an extra zero by mistake I think, but more probable is that that the '10' actually refers to the thread count of the shirt itself because it's not thick at all. I can clearly see the creases of my fingers through the T-shirt. It would be great for certain Tshirt contests though, so there is a small, niche market for thin white T-Shirts.\n\nIn the actual parcel (containing the SINGULAR T-Shirt), in the packing slip it even has the audacity to claim that it's a 10pk, further reinforcing my thread count theory.\n\nI'm giving the same amount of stars as the amount of shirts I got.\n\nTL;DR: You don't get 10 shirts. Shirts are definitely not thick at all. You'd think that if I'm paying 30CAD for a T-shirt, it'd be of decent quality. I'm giving the same amount of stars as the amount of shirts I got.",
          "Great value for money t-shirts. Fit is great and they feel really comfortable. On my second order now and wouldnât hesitate order no 3",
          "I read the most recent reviews from Canada (not sure if other countries can see these reviews), and I was concerned that I was going to have problems with my order. I read that someone only received one shirt, someone received a different brand, different colour, different size, etc. I don't know if it's because my city has a factory that ships Gildan shirts, but I received 10 shirts in the size and colour that I ordered. No issues here!",

          "Back in the day, there weren't many black pocket t-shirt choices. There were two, actually, and Fruit of the Loom always had the most comfortable t-shirts. They lost their way during the \"bacon neck\" years, and over the last 10 years or so, Fruit of the Loom's black pocket tee has become very hard to find. Lots of competitors have cropped up, and it seems that people have migrated over to Carhartt t-shirts as far as popularity is concerned. As a result, every other t-shirt maker has tried to follow Carhartt in making that style of t-shirt. Well, i'm here to tell you that I've tried them all... Carhartt t-shirts feel like they're made out of donkey hide, and the short sleeves are cartoonishly large... They come down past your elbows! In my searching, I found my way back to FTL and these shirts. Rather than purchasing an entire pack of shirts that I won't end up wearing because they just aren't comfortable or don't fit, I decided to only purchase one of these shirts. Fruit of the Loom shirts have historically shrunk on the first wash, and I was worried about that too. I put the shirt on right out of the dryer after the first wash, and it fit perfectly! It didn't shrink at all! Also, this is the most comfortable cotton that Fruit of the Loom has ever used in any shirt! I immediately went back and ordered 6 more of them. This is a 10 star shirt. Ditch the Carhartt donkey hide and get back to the roots with the fruit! Your body will thank you!",
          "I am 9 months pregnant and in this big and tall 4x tee no one would know. Great material & perfect weight. Has the durability of a Hanes beefy tee except it feels more breathable and a bit lighter in the material weight. As a 5â6 lady it comes down to just above my elbows and hits a few inches above my knees. Personally I will use this as a night cloak but I could see it being an ideal go to daily tee if I was big and tall",
          "I am short and round and stretchy t shirts they sale these days makes me look horrible and sence i found these t shirts that dont look like a dress and are round enough and dont stick to me i can go out in public again i recomind these to anyone they are comfortable and have a pocket for my phone they can dress up or down love them ill be getting more",
          "I wanted a loose, soft, short-sleeved tee with slightly longer sleeves. I wear a 2x in a women's shirt but they're all cut to reveal more skin than I like, and I'm very sensitive about my upper arms. I bought this in a 4xl big. Yes, it's big, but it's not heavy or hot and feels so wonderful against my skin. I'm 5'6\", and the shirt falls just above my knees and below my elbows. I knot it at my hips and wear it with leggings and skinny jeans. You can't beat the softness of this tee, and I've just ordered another in navy blue. I wish there were more colors, but I'll be ordering more of what's available.",
          "I am a mom of a jolly green giant my son is 6\"4 finding shirts for him is hard! I took a shot at these couldn't beat the price and they fit like a charm, they are soft and no shrinkage in the wash! Would and will be buying again :-)",
          "Very soft, heavy weight material, not a thin material like normal T-shirts. Very nice product.",
          "The shirt is comfortable, and a good fit for a larger man. It only shrank a small amount when washed and dried the first time, and it didn't shrink anymore after that. It's basic material and looks as though it will stand up to reasonable use.",
          "I expected these to be the same size as the last ones I bought here. Not so. These are considerably larger this time. Pup tent larger.\n\nNext time they will be who knows?\n\nThis is the way of modern clothing production. No two items are ever alike, even within brands and models. These \"American\" brands farm out their work to so many different countries, there's no telling what you'll get.\n\nUsed to be able to buy these at Wally World for less than $5 and they'd always be identical. Now you pay double for a tee shirt lottery ticket.\n\nGood Luck!",

          "Read all of the reviews said that mediums were to large, so I bought a small, which was too small. Then I exchanged it for a medium, which fit perfectly. Needless to say, I'm 5'11 160lbs and medium fit great.",
          "The material seems pretty decent. I accidentally ordered a 2xl slim fit at first without noticing. I tried to cancel it but it was already sent. When I received it I went ahead and tried it on. It actually fit pretty well. I had already ordered a regular fit after I attempted to cancel the slim fit. The regular fit is pretty wide actually. I am 5'11\" and 250lbs. The slim fit was the one that fits me best. I hope this helps someone.\nPS they are currently getting embroidered. I have not washed them yet. I will update if anything happens.",
          "When I was reading other reviews and questions I found myself laughing when someone asked how thick the fabric is because he has dark nipples. Well, I do not have dark nipples and I am definitely showing through my shirt... Really bummed because this is a great color, nice fit, and the price is right. Plus, you can see lines through the shirt from chest hair... Bottom line, go for a darker color.",
          "These shirts are great. They compare to the much more expensive UA and Nike polos and are literally 1/3 the cost. The material is light weight and breathes well. Very comfortable and moves with your body. I'm 5'10\" 195# and ordered the LG. Fits me perfect in the arms, chest, and shoulders. The length is just right to either tuck in or go untucked. I have an athletic build with a bit of muscle. I highly recommend these shirts, especially if you're into a somewhat fitted shirt that shows off the gains.",
          "Love these shirts. I already own a couple of the regular fit ones in this style. Figured I'd give the slim fit a try too. I'm 6', 32\" waist, 195lbs, and the large fit perfectly. Im so happy with it that I immediately ordered 5 more in varying colors. They're perfect for work or the course.",
          "So I was very wary about ordering these because so many people had such mixed reviews, especially about the sizing and durability. I ordered two shirts, both large. Large is what I typically order for most tops so thereâs nothing unusual about that. Iâm 5â9â and 155lbs. Ideally, I like things to fit me a little loose and to have longer sleeves. I can say with 100% certainty that these are not slim fit. Itâs advertised that way, but theyâre just not. Theyâre also a little longer at the bottom than Iâd ordinarily wear. Iâm hoping that after the first couple washes the shirts will shrink, if even just slightly, and help fit them to me more. That said, if you prefer your tops to be more form fitted then Iâd recommend going a size down with these. Theyâre extremely comfortable and the material feels great so donât let this discourage you. I think they could also play really well into casual and business casual looks so itâs worth noting that thereâs the versatility with these as well. Just really think about how you want these to fit before you buy any.",
          "I first tried the regular-fit. I love the golf polo. However, the regular-fit was a bit of a floater. So then I tried the slim-fit. It fits awesome! I really recommend this shirt! It feels nice and fits very nice. (I wear an XL) And the slim-fit doesn't feel like I'm wearing 2 sizes too small, it's just a better fit without the extra width.",
          "Firstly, I am a woman and bought this as I liked the colour. I bought a size large (I normally take size 18 or 20 tops) and the fit of this is lovely. The colour is wonderful and the material definitely a sports 'dry top' material unlike most polo tops. I bought this specifically for golf and it fits the bill exactly.",
          "it fits very well and also the white/blue stripes colour looks nice\nsize M as expected\nit's not real cotton pique, but rather some synthetic light fabric\nthis could be good in hot weather, but haven't tested yet if the fabric might be smelly/sweaty",
          "Before wearing i washed this shirt with whites in the washing machine. I have never experienced or expected the yellow dye to bleed and as a result a good number if my white shirts including that of my wifes white stuff are now colour yellow too. I donât even know if i would get compensated for the damage this shirt has inflicted to our white garments",
          "Donât get me wrong, this isnât the best polo ever, but I gave it 5 stars as the fit and look punches way above its weight for the price. It washes well too - hasnât lost any shape at all.",

          "Used as a top for my husbands Linda Belcher Costume, worked perfectly.",
          "Awesome shirt -- my new go-to long sleeve shirt. I'm an athletically-built 6'0\" /170 lbs. (broader shoulders, narrower waist), and this shirt in a medium fits perfectly. It has plenty of room through the chest and shoulders yet is snug around the midsection for a nicer, slimming look. Also, the length is perfect for wearing untucked. It falls about halfway down the zipper on my pants. The cotton is definitely a heavy-weight cotton, and it feels very nice. The only thing I dislike is the contrasting fabric under the section of the shirt where it buttons. On the black shirt, there is gray fabric that is visible unless you button all three buttons. Same with the navy blue shirt. It looks okay, but I'd prefer if it was just monochromatic. Overall, this is a fantastic shirt. Highly recommended.",
          "I like how this looks and feels. I noticed some people said they had theirs delivered ripped but mine was good. Not sure how it will hold up after a was but it should come out good.",
          "Ok, I'm probably going to keep this one. I've been trying different low priced Henley's, and have recently sent a couple back (I won't go into why), but these are reasonably high quality and reasonably heavy (about like a heavy duty T-shirt). I rated the fit as \"somewhat small\", because I paid attention to what other reviewers had said in that regard, and I went ahead and ordered an extra large, where I usually get a large. That seems to be the right call, as the extra large seems to fit comfortably (before washing), I'll update if there's any significant shrinkage later. I checked the Hanes website, and it says all are 100% cotton except the Heather which is 75% ... so I ordered the green body with heather sleeves, and the tag says pretty close to what the website says ... the body is 100% cotton, while the sleeves are 60/40. I'm still looking for a good thermal version of a Henley, if anyone has any suggestions, but I do like this one and I will be ordering more.\n\nAddendum: A little caveat to keep in mind, they are selling two completely different shirts here. The two tone sports team look, is part 100% cotton and part blend (the heather color), and that shirt is cut altogether different. The solid color is all 100% cotton, and has a seam across the top of the shoulders, then the sleeve meets the torso in a circle. The sports team look has a seam that cuts down from the neck at roughly a 45 degree angle, so the sleeve section meets the body section under the arms. I'm not complaining, I like them both, but the two different shirts that are being sold here hang off your shoulders and fit entirely different, they should advertise separately.",
          "I liked the first one so much I ordered a second. The second one did not live up to my expectations. My orders were maybe a month apart, so it's disappointing that the quality can change in such a short period of time. The first one was indeed beefy and fit great. The second shirt was much thinner and fit much tighter. I would have ordered a size up if I knew it was going to be smaller. The label is different so I know this new shirt is a different batch. I would not recommend this new style. I wanted to leave a good review but the new one is just plain bad. I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of money. I guess I'll donate the new one since I'm not going to wear it. I would rather donate directly to a charity in the future though.",
          "Iâm male, 5â9â tall, and weigh 210 pounds. I purchased these in medium size and they fit my 42 inch chest well. The 100 percent cotton shirts did shrink after a wash and drying, but stretched back over my body easily. If you were hoping to achieve a baggier aesthetic, this might not work for you. The cotton and polyester blend shrink less. The colors that came in 100 percent cotton were dark truffle, ebony, burnt brick, and petro teal. Pebblestone Heather and Navy Heather were constructed of 75 percent cotton and 25 percent polyester. The shirts arenât perfect, but they are decent.",
          "I love Henley shirts, but Iâve found that women donât have as vast a selection as men so I shopped for menâs. I LOVE this shirt! Great material, sturdy, yet lightweight. Beautiful color too! (My photo doesnât do the color justice). I went with a size S (5â4â and 127lbs) and it fits PERFECTLY. I have broad shoulders so the top portion fits well. The torso area is long, but I just tuck part of it in anyway, and has a little bit of stretch room which I was surprised how closely it fit my body for menâs size. The sleeves go down to my thumb, but I donât mind long sleeves. Will probably buy more!!!",

          "Iâm 5â10â and ordered a size large in blue. I saw all the reviews saying these shirts shrink in the wash and they do a bit! But they didnât shrink as drastically as some of the other reviews said. The photo with me wearing shorts (not visible) is fresh out of the package and the others are after being washed. You can see the collar, length, and width are a bit decreased but not anything really noticeable. They feel smaller than they look smaller.\nThe post-shrink shirts fit exactly how I like them though, so thatâs great! I recently started as a cashier at Ross Dress for Less and wanted some shirts designated for work. These match the company color perfectly and theyâre thin but solid cotton so they donât get hot while Iâm working but also donât fall in that weird drapey way some vans shirts hang etc.",
          "These t-shirts will shrink bad. I am including a picture of my 6 month old t-shirts (same brand, black) vs. brand new white ones. They're tagless and all, very comfortable and won't fade much, but the shrinking factor might be of your concern especially if you order \"L\". Mine are \"S\" and now they fit like a slim-fit t-shirt which is fine for me but for some this may be relevant.",
          "Hey not sure how helpful this will be given Im a female an this is a mens tshirt. But long story short needed a red shirt for a job didnt matter the style just had to be red. I buy smalls in hanes mens tshirts at the store just for around the house so i knew my size atleast for the plain white ones. I dont like it fitted but i dont wanna look like im drowning either. Im more of a athletic build size 4 or a 26 pants or 3-5 in juniors. Tops in womens i always get smalls im not overly busty 34c an these fit great. I prefer hanes for the simple fact the are longer than other brands an dont look boxy after a few washes not to mention no tags truely a great tshirt. Fyi i notice white tshirts always tend to shrink more than the colored shirts not sure why but in my experience thats what happens but still fit just a bit more form fitting. An just an fyi if a female is lookong for a tshirt for lazy days or whatever or just to wear on ick days if you have a little belly on ya nice cover for those days but if you have yourself a belly that is more obvious this may not be what your looking for or maybe try a size up.",
          "These are definitely NOT comfort soft as advertised. My husband has been getting Hanes for years and we made the mistake of ordering them here because we found a good deal. Well, you get what you pay for..these must be a knock off or something. They were rough and itch even AFTER a wash. When we got them we realized there was no way they were true Hanes shirts. We submitted a return request but the seller was going to charge a 20% restocking fee and we had to pay for shipping so beware prior to buying. We tried washing a couple times to see if they would get any better but no luck. So we are now using as cleaning rags. So if youâre okay with low quality itchy and rough undershirts, then buy these!",
          "Great Deal. Great Feel! Nice & Long to tuck in. Comfortable around Neck",
          "I bought a couple packages of these in black to use as undershirts for my work dress shirts. I tried them on when the first arrived and the length was good. After a single wash (cold) and dry (warm) they have lost at least 2\" in length, making them near impossible to tuck in and remain tucked in. So for anyone wondering... Yes, these shrink quite a lot in the length. Interestingly they did not really shrink at all around the chest/waist dimension.\n\nA couple other issues I had with these, that I have not had with other brands is that the seam along the bottom of the shirt and around the ends of the arms was not flat. If these were not meant as undershirts I envision I would be going through and having to do some serious ironing to ensure all the seams were down nicely.\n\nLastly, the elastic around the neck seems to be of lower quality material and is not as taunt as I guess I would prefer. It definitely seems like a few washes in, the neck is going to be very loose and \"bacon-ie\" looking.\n\nI certainly will be looking to other brands from here on out.",

          "Nothing close to \"ComfortSoft\" at all as stated. Even after several washes and dry, these shirts are still itchy and uncomfortable and if you are wearing it during warm days you will sweat in them and it will become itchy on your skin. I wear this as my undershirt for work while wearing my uniform-issued short sleeve button down shirt and I'm already sweating within minutes. I had 3 older versions of Hanes ComfortSoft Ts just like these ones before and they were very soft and not itchy to wear. The material was perfect and not too thick or too thin. These newer ones here are just ridiculously too thick and itchy.",

The material is thinner, itchier, attracts lint. The cut is smaller, more akward (uncomforable, angled, much smaller sleeves), The collar is thin, wrinkles immediately, and stays that way. The number of stitches is far fewer. Bottom line - Do not buy! It's a shame to see another, once-great company sink into mediocrity.",

Either they have started making cheaper versions of their good shirts, or quality control is sliding. I'll be looking into other brand names in the future.\nUPDATE 12-24-20: I received these in October, and they are already coming apart at the seams.

These fit me well about right before being washed, and after wash they are tight.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say is they are cheap.\n\nHow bad can it be from Hanes? Now you know.",

          "We washed these shirts before wearing them and they are one size smaller than expected. Luckily I ordered a size bigger because being cotton I figured they might shrink some on the first wash. They are medium weight, should last reasonably well and the pockets on this batch are deep enough your cell phone doesn't try to fall out of it. Previous batch of all white Hanes T Shirts, the pocket was built too short. These new ones look nice, the dark red, light blue and black can be worn as a shirt. The greys really look like undershirts. The other good thing about them is they are long enough that they tuck into your pants and stay tucked in.",

          "Could have said these were too large... 3X is gigantic. They are just perfect though for the intended purpose. My partner uses tee shirts as pyjama tops and these are great... comfortably baggy and so long it's kind of like a 'nightshirt' of days past. :) They're a hit."

          "I recommend these T-shirts. I am 5'8\" and 140\", I do not like tight T-shirts so I bought a large. I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked.\n\nI will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.\n\nPro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom. Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.\n\nCon - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer after a first washing. I washed the Gildan T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.\n\nNeutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.\n\nI hope that this review is helpful to you.\n\nUpdate - June 2, 2020. The Gildan T-shirts that I bought previously held up reasonably well for the money. They did not shrink. They did not fade. However, they did not get softer. Washing was on warm and drying was three minutes on energy saver.\n\nI purchased some more Gildans to replace the ones that wore out. I have not washed them yet. I bought Galapagos Blue and Orange in Large size. Both are 100% cotton. The necks seem smaller than the Fruit of the Loom Platinums that I own. I like that because I have a small head so I don't need a big neck. I am still 5'8\" and 140 pounds and the Large is comfortable for me. A medium would probably fit me better; however, I like a looser-fitting T-shirt.\n\nI will let you know how well the new Gildans do after washing in warm water and drying for three minutes on energy saving heat.\n\nNotably, I have some old Fruit of the Loom T-shirts (like ten years or more) which are reasonably thick, reasonably soft, and still going strong after all this time. I wish that I had bought more of them.\n\nJune 10, 2020 - After one wash in warm water and three minutes in the dryer, the new Gildans did not shrink or fade. Also, the necks did not stretch. However, the T-shirts did not become softer. Therefore, three out of the four results were good and one result was neutral.\n\nSeptember 20, 2020 - After multiple washings in warm water and three minutes in the dryer on \"energy saving\", the verdict is the same. Good - the T-shirts did not shrink or fade and the necks did not stretch. Bad - The T-shirts did not get any softer. One other note - the tags on the T-shirts would be very annoying to wear so I cut the tags out.\n\nNovember 22, 2020 - The first thing to go bad on these T-shirts has been that the necks have stretched slightly. The stretching was not terrible but it is noticeable (at least to me). Nevertheless, I would give the T-shirts 4.5 stars. They do seem a little but softer or maybe I am getting more used to them. They do not feel scratchy to me. They have not faded or shrunk. I definitely like them much better than the ultra-thin Fruit of the Loom Platinum.\n\nNovember 28, 2020 - I have purchased only Large-size Gildan T-shirts. I am very happy that the sizing has been very consistent. Gildan has much better quality control than Fruit of the Loom.\n\nMarch 11, 2021 - I have revised the rating to a five stars. The T-shirts have gotten soft after probably 10 - 12 washings. The necks have stretched slightly but not very much. I am picky about that so I may notice that more than most people would. I dry the T-shirts by putting them in the dryer on energy saving setting for three minutes and then laying them on a bamboo drying rack. I do NOT dry them by putting them on hangers. The T-shirts still look great with no fading. I wear them frequently and enjoy the various colors.\n\nSeptember 16, 2021 - The T-shirts are still doing well. One note, I think that the 6.0 weight fabric is much better than the 5.3 weight fabric. I bought some 5.3 weight lime green T-shirts to try to make myself more visible when walking. The necks have sagged after four washes. They served the purpose for the summer. However, I would not buy the 5.3 ounce again. The 6.0 ounce T-shirts have maintained their shape with minimal neck sagging or crinkling.",
          "Iâm a big girl. 5â3â and 250 lbs. I usually wear XL or XXL because sizes are so inconsistent. These shirts are a true XL! They fit my chest without pulling up too much in the front. They arenât too snug but donât look loose and frumpy either. The material is thick and even though they might shrink a bit in the wash, thereâs enough room that they still wonât be too small. Iâll definitely be buying these again.",
          "My husband actually has T-shirts older than our college-age grandson. Some looked as if he was present and against the wall at the Valentine's Day Massacre. I've slowly been trashing them as he brings them to be laundered and I was looking to replace some of his around-the house T-shirts. He likes them reasonably soft and medium weight. I sent off for a set of two of these and he really likes them. He wore them one right after the other, and the second they had went thru wash and dry cycle, he put them on again. Which made it appear that he'd been wearing the same shirt (after second wash) for six days. So, I sent off for 4 more in different colors and he actually scooped up the package and thanked me for getting them for him. He has never thanked me for buying him clothes! Do soak them in the sink in cold water to make sure the dye is not going to run first. So far shrinkage was minimum, but I am glad that I purchased on size up. This isn't dress wear, but these T-shirts are really nice and he wears them almost everywhere he goes. The colors are great and they look pretty darn good.",
          "Used to be, ages ago before online shopping, that the big brands (Hanes, Fruit of the Loom) always made reliable t-shirts. Lately, not so much the case, and it seems to be more difficult to just find a comfortable, quality t-shirt that isn't overpriced. I rely on these for sleeping, along with a comfy pair of shorts, but my aged t-shirts, from Champion, are wearing out, and I can't find those anymore.\n\nSo, looking at t-shirts I've liked, that I've bought at sporting events or motorsports events, I noticed a lot of them were Gildan shirts, and all of them were comfortable and durable and fit well. That's what led me to a search for that brand, and I found these.\n\nOrdered them up, and, for an affordable price, they are terrific, and just like the ones for which I pay twenty five bucks or more, when buying emblazoned with a logo or whatever at an event kiosk, so, yup, the same outstanding shirts, just far less pricey. Now that I've tried these, I'm going to order up some more, and finally retire my old worn out t-shirts that have served me so well all these years.\n\nA great find!",
          "These are my husband's favorite shirts, they are thick and durable. We will be buying more.",
          "These shirts are very comfortable! When first looking at it the collar âlooked uncomfortableâ but once I put it on it fits just right. Obviously Iâm a petite young adult haha buying a mans shirt. But, the small still fits perfectly!\n\nIâve been searching for basic black tops for the longest thatâs a reasonable price as well as comfortable! And this is the way to go.",
          "As expected this shirt is heavy %100 cotton. It is what I was hoping for. I usually wear a LG to XL (I have broad shoulders and am carrying extra weight around the middle and chest). After reading other reviews I decided to buy 3packs of 2XL hoping they would shrink to my size. I added some pictures to show the side to side shrinkage (about an inch after 1 wash in warm water and heavy dryer setting. I was sick of getting that thin material in all the t-shirts from the big W and other stores. They are still a bit big but I know that after a couple more washes they will fit better. I wanted a heavier material for work and also to hide a bit of gut until I lose the weight. Because these are %100 cotton after time I'm guessing they might need folding or ironing (I only hang my t's and they didn't need after 1 wash). They have double stitching and a good quality neck...no stretching so far. The colour in 2 of the pics looks grayish but all six shirts were black (it was just the flash).",
          "I won't buy these again. I don't know if all Gildan t-shirts are like this, but the fabric is rough and hasn't softened in several washes. The fit, in this order and in another with long-sleeved shirts, is erratic. Half of the shirts fit and half were too small. I had to stretch the neck in most of them, even if the body fit. The length was good, though, which is important, but when half the order is unwearable, length doesn't bring much satisfaction. The order arrived on time and appropriately packaged.",
          "Yo la usÃ© para un vestido oversized\nQuedo muy bien\nLa calidad es excelente, muy bien el color y material!",
          "",
          "Ordered these for my husband to wear to work. The material did not feel nice at all, very cheap, but we figured for the price it was still pretty good. It did not take long for holes to start appearing in the shirts (maybe a couple of months). He kept wearing them a bit longer only because they were worn as undershirts so you could not see the holes. However, you obviously do not want new clothes to have holes in them for no reason. Would not buy again.",

It looks appropriate in the office, but also at happy hour later. This shirt is low maintenance, has plenty of length so that it stays tucked in, and if you have the body to pull it off - Slim Fit or Modern Fit is the name of the game these days.\n\nI am not a model. I do not have perfect proportions, I've still got a little more belly than I'd like. But I also lift, have broad shoulder and thick arms, and this shirt works fine for me. You don't need to be Brad Pitt to wear this thing and look good in it, but if you're a pear-shaped 'average american man' this is probably not the shirt for you.\n\nI'll be buying more like this, I wish they had more colors!

He is 5'10, 175lbs and wears a M in this shirt. The arms are fitted and snug to the muscles. After all, this is what guys want who are showing off their hard gym work.\n\nVery pleased with these shirts!",
          "I absolutely love this polo. I'm a very picky buyer esp with clothes. Here's pros and cons\n\nPros\n\n60 cotton / 40 poly blend. I prefer this; seems more durable, wrinkle resistant, and color retention\n\nNo spandex etc. Some polos / shirts have spandex to help with stretchability. I rather avoid it in shirts because when it gets out of dryer, it'll shrink. Don't want a shirt to contour my rolls lol. If I was fit, I would understand spandex in shirts, but I'm not.\n\nPique / knit fabric rather than jersey. Looks more professional, seems more wrinkle resistant, and feels more stretchable. I always prefer pique polos.\n\nHas a durable weight and feel to the fabric too. I tried a different brand, also pique 60/40 fabric, but felt smoother / silkier, and draped more. Not as professional feeling IMO. Not sure if that was the best choice for polos. I don't like shirts to drape my rolls.\n\nRibbed arms just feels and look more professional IMO\n\nLONG. Maybe because you need to order a size up so ends up having a lot of length. If you tuck your polos, this is perfect. If you do not (I know most people do not so I'll list this under Cons too), too long for untucked!\n\nCONS\n\nToo small. MUST order 1 size up\n\nVERY LONG. May be good if you're a tucker like me but I know most people don't tuck their polos. I will say these are definitely waaaay too long for untucked",
          "I have decades of shirts, literally decades, in large and extra large. I know what a large is. And what an extra large is. Apparently, so did everyone who made polos and t-shirts for decades.\n\nSo why the hell does Lee unilaterally decide to change the definition of large and extra large by not one, but two full sizes? You got me.\n\nI tried THREE times to buy one of these shirts to fit the size and style. My last attempt (Lee size XXL, Everybody Else Size L), the neck / collar was SIGNIFICANTLY larger than the size just below it --- which made it look more like one of those awful multi-button Golf shirts than a 2-button Polo.\n\nI'm done with Lee. So irritating.",
          "I've just been learning more about polos and other mens shirt styles recently. A good polo should not have more than a couple of inches of cloth on either side of the body and should not fall to lower than than mid-crotch when untucked. This shirt fits quite well (I ordered a medium) but unfortunately it is far too long to wear untucked AND has a tail. I do not like my polos to have a tail where the rear bottom is longer than the front bottom. It's a shame so many manufacturers do not design polos for wearing untucked or provide the length measurements for a better online shopping experience.\nAlso, you should know that this is a pique cotton style with a textured weave. For a pique fabric is fairly soft. If you are looking for smooth and very soft polo you should look for pima cotton which this is not.\nIf you are looking for a basic polo that fits well and you either will always wear it tucked in, or simply do not mind a long polo with a tail, then this polo is an excellent value for the money. If you're looking for something you can wear casually and untucked I don't think this one quite lives up to its billing.",

As an elderly retired person and living in a rest home, it's heavy enough to Keep me warm on the chilly mornings.\n\nI liked these so much that I immediately ordered another pair of the shirts, only this time in Black. they arrived right on schedule and we're also made in the Honduras. 100% cotton and the same quality stitching as was in the blue ones. one of the male nurses saw the shirts and when he found out how inexpensive they were and what good qualities they were he also ordered himself some. If you are considering buying it these t-shirts, do yourself a favor and get to it! I am fairly certain that I will be ordering some more of these.\n#NOTE: SHORT UPDATE! #\n\nI went ahead and bought 2 more, this time in black. Arrived on time. These were made in Nicaragua rather than in the Honduras like my other ones were. However the same quality of material and care of the stitching is present, so I'm sure these will be as good as the blue ones.\n\n***YET ANOTHER UPDATE!\nHere it is most 2020,and all thes3e shirts still look brand new!

Verifying that each shirt measured the same initially, one was kept as received and the other was laundered twice:\n\nFirst cycle = warm wash / low temp dry.\nMeasured\nWorn for 6 hours.\nSecond cycle = hot wash / medium-high dry.\nRemeasured\n\nInterestingly, about 90% of the shrinkage occurred during the first, low temp laundering.\n\nMeasurements: initial / final\n\nLength (back of neck to hem): 30\" / 27.5\"\nWidth (6\" from bottom): 22\" / 21\"\nSleeve (from shoulder): 25\" / 23\"\n\nWhen shrunk it's within the range of a typical Men's size Large, although not particularly roomy.

Fortunately for me the chest/waist are not billowy, but it is the typical \"American\" fit but not so awfully billowy.\n\nBut... as I'll only wear this around the house and yard, or for running errands, I would re-order. Be sure to order a size larger.",

The thickness of the material seems to vary by color and when you purchase the shirts. Some of my white long sleeves are thinner than other ones I own. I would suggest this as a good shirt to purchase. Buy one size larger and after a warm wash and drying it will shrink perfectly.",

In general, the Fruit of the Loom are softer, the cuffs of Hanes are tighter (which I like), and the cuffs of the Gildan shirts seem to stretch out more quickly than the other two (which I don't like). The quality of fabric of all three seems OK to me, they all seem to wash equally well. If I needed another shirt of this kind, and my size was available, and the price differences weren't substantial, I would buy Fruit of the Loom first, Hanes second and Gildan as a third choice. The Gildan would not be my preferred choice but it would be acceptable.",
          "I",
          "I also have Fruit of the loom shirts which are the same size and are very poor quality. They have shrunk after the first wash and continue to.\n\nGildan quality is far superior and much more comfortable and they wash well too. Iâm so pleased that I purchased these. Itâs worth spending the money for this quality.",
          "Bought for work as i have to cover my arms on machines for swarf. But i work in a foundry, so quite warm on a normal day, so a sweatshirt wasn't an option. Size was slightly bigger than expected. Could of gone a size down. Comfortable to wear and fit well. I would check your chest size against chart. If you like a bit baggy go for size or if you want it a spot on fit not tight i would say a size down. Gildan are generous in sizing.",
          "Cuffs fell off on first day wearing the shirt. Both wrist cuffs fell off brand new shirt"

          "This shirt fit exactly as I hoped and expected. It's lighter weight, so if you want something a little dressier in hot weather this will work. The snap buttons are perfect (which is less common than you would think), and the cut, design and stitching are nicely executed. It is not totally wrinkle-free, but if you dry it up until it's only slightly damp and then hand-dry it will not need ironing unless you want to look very dressed up. Plus the price is pretty good.",
          "Works well for what I'm using it for.",
          "Fits well. Was worried it was gonna be boxy fitting like a lot of non slim cuts but itâs great if you have shoulders or like a little room in the chest/torso to move around. The white one is nice enough to wear under a nice jacket or let your kids wipe ketchup all over you.",
          "My husband requested I buy more of these shirts to wear on his daily zoom calls. The snaps make it quick and easy for him to put on and take off, and the white shows up well on camera. The large size fits slightly bigger than his normal business shirt with a 15-1/2â neck, and the arms are a little fuller - which makes it more comfortable as he uses his keyboard for hours.\n\nTip: They do come out of the dryer a little wrinkly, so I do spend a couple minutes a shirt to iron the collar, the front yoke, the front of the sleeves, and down to the waist on the front. Thatâs all that shows on the zoom so thatâs all I iron!",
          "Overall, this is a nice shirt. It is well made out of light-weight cotton fabric. It washes and irons nicely. The shirt does not taper down to the waist (as the traditional style). Instead, this is more contemporary with a straight cut. The size is plenty large and the sleeve length is good for those, like me, who have longer arms. I am very happy with the shirt.",
          "I like wrangler clothes I have a few if their jeans and shirts so I know what size to order thus one was true to form fits like their other stuff no surprises.its also a very nice shirt 3 snaps on the sleeve cuffs plenty of snaps on from its a really nice looking shirt very comfortable to wear i like it so much i actually ordered a second one today",
          "This shirt did run slightly large like other reviewers stated. My man usually takes an XL in shirts so that's what we ordered. It was a little big in the shoulders, but not enough to return. He did like the fact that the sleeves were long enough, and the neck fit well. Overall it looked like a decent shirt to wear out in a casual setting.",
          "I expected wrangler clothes to be of a better quality as I have worn good quality from them before , this shirt material was very thin not the thick cotton type i was expecting from Wrangle . I sent this back and was refunded very quickly .I will still look for another of the same make but from a shop so I can see the thickness of material.",
          "Product fits perfect but was expecting the shirt a lot thicker than what they are for wrangler but saying that will be ideal for summer wear",
          "The shirt is really smart and looks fantastic along with being very comfortable",
          "Ordered the white one, the fit is fine if a touch roomy, surprised at how thin the material is, I certainly couldn't hide my tattoo's init; more surprising is the fact that it has no Wrangler logo?",
          "This shirt is just what we were looking for and considering it came from the USA I only waited a week for it. This shirt was bought for our upcoming cowboy style wedding in Arizona in October and could not get anything like this in the uk.\n\nMy partner flits between a medium and large in tops and the medium in this shirt was perfect maybe slightly more on the generous size."
